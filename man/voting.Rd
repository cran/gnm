\title{Data on Social Mobility and the Labour Vote}
\description{
  Voting data from the 1987 British general election, cross-classified
  by the class of the head of household and the class of their father.
}
\usage{data(voting)}
\format{
  A data frame with 25 observations on the following 4 variables.
  \describe{
    \item{\code{percentage}}{the percentage of the cell voting Labour.}
    \item{\code{total}}{the cell count.}
    \item{\code{origin}}{a factor describing the father's class with
      levels \code{1:5}.} 
    \item{\code{destination}}{a factor describing the head of
      household's class with levels \code{1:5}.}
