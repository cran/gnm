\section{Introduction}

The \Rpackage{gnm} package provides facilities for fitting
\emph{generalized nonlinear models}, i.e., regression models in which the
link-transformed mean is described as a sum of predictor terms, some of
which may be non-linear in the unknown parameters.  Linear and generalized
linear models,
as handled by the \Rfunction{lm} and \Rfunction{glm} functions in \R, are
included in the class
of generalized nonlinear models, as the special case in which there is no
nonlinear term.

This document gives an extended overview of the \Rpackage{gnm} package, with
some examples of applications.  The primary package documentation in the
form of standard help pages, as viewed in \R\ by, for example, \Rcode{?gnm} or
\Rcode{help(gnm)}, is supplemented rather than replaced by the present
document.

We begin below with a preliminary note (Section \ref{sec:glms}) on some
ways in which
the \Rpackage{gnm} package extends \R's facilities for specifying, fitting
and working with generalized \emph{linear} models.  Then (Section
\ref{sec:nonlinear} onwards) the facilities for nonlinear terms are introduced,
explained and exemplified.

The \Rpackage{gnm} package is installed in the standard way for CRAN packages,
for example by using \Rfunction{install.packages}.  Once installed, the
package is loaded into an \R\ session by
<<Load_gnm>>=
library(gnm)
@

\section{Generalized linear models}
\label{sec:glms}

\subsection{Preamble}

Central to the facilities provided by the \Rpackage{gnm} package is the
model-fitting function \Rfunction{gnm}, which interprets a model formula
and returns a model object.  The user interface of \Rfunction{gnm} is patterned
after \Rfunction{glm} (which is included in \R's standard \Rpackage{stats}
package), and indeed
\Rfunction{gnm} can be viewed as a replacement for
\Rfunction{glm} for specifying and fitting generalized linear models.
In general there is no reason to prefer \Rfunction{gnm} to \Rfunction{glm} for
fitting generalized linear models, except perhaps when the model involves a
large number of incidental parameters which are treatable
by \Rfunction{gnm}'s \emph{eliminate} mechanism (see Section \ref{sec:eliminate}).

While the main purpose of the \Rpackage{gnm} package is to extend the class of
models to include nonlinear terms, some of the new functions and methods
can be used also with the familiar \Rfunction{lm} and \Rfunction{glm}
model-fitting functions.  These are: three new data-manipulation functions
\Rfunction{Diag}, \Rfunction{Symm} and \Rfunction{Topo}, for setting up structured interactions between factors; a new \Rclass{family} function,
\Rfunction{wedderburn},
for modelling a continuous
response variable in $[0,1]$ with the variance function
$V(\mu) = \mu^2(1-\mu)^2$ as in \citet{Wedd74};
and a new generic function \Rfunction{termPredictors} which
extracts the contribution of each term to the predictor from a fitted model
object.  These functions are briefly introduced here, before we move on to
the main purpose of the package,
nonlinear models, in Section \ref{sec:nonlinear}.

\subsection{\Rfunction{Diag} and \Rfunction{Symm}}

When dealing with \emph{homologous} factors, that is, categorical variables
whose levels are the same, statistical models often involve structured
interaction terms which exploit the inherent symmetry.  The functions
\Rfunction{Diag} and \Rfunction{Symm} facilitate the specification of such
structured interactions.

As a simple example of their use, consider the log-linear models of
\emph{quasi-independence}, \emph{quasi-symmetry} and \emph{symmetry}
for a square contingency table.  \citet{Agre02}, Section 10.4, gives data on
migration between regions of the USA between 1980 and 1985:
<<migrationData>>=
count <- c(11607,   100,   366,   124,
              87, 13677,   515,   302,
             172,   225, 17819,   270,
              63,   176,   286, 10192 )
region <- c("NE", "MW", "S", "W")
row <-  gl(4, 4, labels = region)
col <-  gl(4, 1, length = 16, labels = region)
@
The comparison of models reported by Agresti can be achieved as follows:
<<squareTableModels>>=
independence <- glm(count ~ row + col, family = poisson)
quasi.indep <- glm(count ~ row + col + Diag(row, col), family = poisson)
symmetry <- glm(count ~ Symm(row, col), family = poisson)
quasi.symm <- glm(count ~ row + col + Symm(row, col), family = poisson)
comparison1 <- anova(independence, quasi.indep, quasi.symm)
print(comparison1, digits = 7)
comparison2 <- anova(symmetry, quasi.symm)
print(comparison2)
@

The \Rfunction{Diag} and \Rfunction{Symm} functions also generalize the notions
of diagonal and symmetric interaction to cover situations involving more than
two homologous factors.

\subsection{\Rfunction{Topo}}

More general structured interactions than those provided by \Rfunction{Diag}
and \Rfunction{Symm} can be specified using the function \Rfunction{Topo}.
(The name of this function is short for `topological interaction',
which is the nomenclature
often used in sociology for factor interactions with structure derived from
subject-matter theory.)

The \Rfunction{Topo} function operates on any number ($k$, say)
of input factors, and
requires an argument named \Rfunarg{spec} which must be an array of
dimension $L_1 \times \ldots \times L_k$, where $L_i$ is the number of
levels for the $i$th factor.  The \Rfunarg{spec} argument specifies
the interaction level corresponding to every possible combination of
the input factors, and the result is a new factor representing the specified
interaction.

As an example, consider fitting the `log-multiplicative layer effects' models
described in \citet{Xie92}.  The data are 7 by 7 versions of social mobility
tables from \citet{Erik82}:
<<EriksonData>>=
data(erikson)
### Collapse to 7 by 7 table as in Erikson et al. (1982)
erikson <- as.data.frame(erikson)
lvl <- levels(erikson$origin)
levels(erikson$origin) <- levels(erikson$destination) <-
    c(rep(paste(lvl[1:2], collapse = " + "), 2), lvl[3],
      rep(paste(lvl[4:5], collapse = " + "), 2), lvl[6:9])
erikson <- xtabs(Freq ~ origin + destination + country, data = erikson)
@
From sociological theory --- for which see \citet{Erik82} or \citet{Xie92} ---
the log-linear interaction between origin and destination is assumed to have
a particular structure:
\newpage
\begin{Sinput}
> levelMatrix <- matrix(c(2, 3, 4, 6, 5, 6, 6,
+                         3, 3, 4, 6, 4, 5, 6,
+                         4, 4, 2, 5, 5, 5, 5,
+                         6, 6, 5, 1, 6, 5, 2,
+                         4, 4, 5, 6, 3, 4, 5,
+                         5, 4, 5, 5, 3, 3, 5,
+                         6, 6, 5, 3, 5, 4, 1), 7, 7, byrow = TRUE)
\end{Sinput}
The models of table 3 of \citet{Xie92} can now be fitted as follows:
\begin{Sinput}
> ### Fit the levels models given in Table 3 of Xie (1992)
> ## Null association between origin and destination
> nullModel <- gnm(Freq ~ country:origin + country:destination,
+                  family = poisson, data = erikson, verbose = FALSE)
>
> ## Interaction specified by levelMatrix, common to all countries
> commonTopo <- update(nullModel, ~ . +
+                      Topo(origin, destination, spec = levelMatrix),
+                      verbose = FALSE)
>
> ## Interaction specified by levelMatrix, different multiplier for
> ## each country
> multTopo <- update(nullModel, ~ . +
+                    Mult(Exp(country), Topo(origin, destination, spec = levelMatrix)),
+                    verbose = FALSE)
>
> ## Interaction specified by levelMatrix, different effects for
> ## each country
> separateTopo <- update(nullModel, ~ . +
+                        country:Topo(origin, destination, spec = levelMatrix),
+                        verbose = FALSE)
>
> anova(nullModel, commonTopo, multTopo, separateTopo)
\end{Sinput}

\end{Soutput}
Here we have used \Rfunction{gnm} to fit all of these log-link models; the
first, second and fourth are log-linear and could equally well have been fitted
using \Rfunction{glm}.

\subsection{The \Rfunction{wedderburn} family}

In \citet{Wedd74} it was suggested to represent the mean of
a continuous response variable in
$[0,1]$ using a quasi-likelihood model with logit link and the
variance function $\mu^2(1-\mu)^2$.  This is not one of the variance
functions made available as standard in \R's \Rfunction{quasi} family.  The
\Rfunction{wedderburn} family provides it.  As an example, Wedderburn's
analysis of data on leaf blotch on barley can be reproduced as follows:
<<wedderburn>>=
data(barley)  ##  data from Wedderburn (1974), see ?barley
logitModel <- glm(y ~ site + variety, family = wedderburn, data = barley)
fit <- fitted(logitModel)
print(sum((barley$y - fit)^2 / (fit * (1-fit))^2))
@
This agrees with the chi-squared value reported on page 331 of \citet{McCu89},
which differs slightly from Wedderburn's own reported value.

\subsection{\Rfunction{termPredictors}}
\label{sec:termPredictors}

The generic function \Rfunction{termPredictors} extracts a term-by-term
decomposition of the predictor function in a linear, generalized linear or
generalized nonlinear model.

As an illustrative example, we can decompose the linear predictor in the above
quasi-symmetry model as follows:
<<termPredictors>>=
print(temp <- termPredictors(quasi.symm))
rowSums(temp) - quasi.symm$linear.predictors
@

Such a decomposition might be useful, for example, in assessing the relative
contributions of different terms or groups of terms.

\section{Nonlinear terms}
\label{sec:nonlinear}

The main purpose of the \Rpackage{gnm} package is to provide
a flexible framework for the specification and
estimation of generalized models with nonlinear terms. The facility provided
with \Rfunction{gnm} for the specification of nonlinear terms is designed to be
compatible with the symbolic language used in \Rclass{formula}
objects. Primarily, nonlinear terms are specified in the model formula as calls
to functions of the class \Rclass{nonlin}.
There are a number of \Rclass{nonlin} functions included in the
\Rpackage{gnm} package. Some of these specify simple mathematical functions of
predictors: \Rfunction{Exp}, \Rfunction{Mult}, and \Rfunction{Inv}.
%\Rfunction{Log}, \Rfunction{Raise} (to raise to a constant power), and \Rfunction{Logit}.
Others
specify more specialized nonlinear terms, in particular \Rfunction{MultHomog}
specifies homogeneous multiplicative interactions and \Rfunction{Dref} specifies
diagonal reference terms. Users may also define their own \Rclass{nonlin}
functions.

\subsection{Basic mathematical functions of predictors}
\label{sec:Basic}

Most of the \Rclass{nonlin} functions included in \Rpackage{gnm} are basic
mathematical functions of predictors:
\begin{description}
\setlength{\itemindent}{-0.5cm}
\item[\Rfunction{Exp}:] the exponential of a predictor
\item[\Rfunction{Inv}:] the reciprocal of a predictor
%\item[\Rfunction{Log}:] the natural logarithm of a predictor
%\item[\Rfunction{Logit}:] the logit of a predictor
\item[\Rfunction{Mult}:] the product of predictors
%\item[\Rfunction{Raise}:] a predictor raised to a constant power
\end{description}
Predictors are specified by symbolic expressions that are interpreted as the
right-hand side of a \Rclass{formula} object, except that an intercept is
\textbf{not} added by default.

The predictors may contain nonlinear terms, allowing more complex functions to
be built up. For example, suppose we wanted to specify a logistic predictor with
the same form as that used by \Rfunction{SSlogis} (a
  selfStart model for use with \Rfunction{nls} --- see
  section~\ref{sec:gnmVnls} for
  more on \Rfunction{gnm} vs.\ \Rfunction{nls}):
\[\frac{\text{Asym}}{1 + \exp((\text{xmid} - x)/\text{scal})}.\]
This expression could be simplified by re-parameterizing in terms of xmid/scal
and 1/scal, however we shall continue with this form for illustration.
We could express this predictor symbolically as follows
\begin{Scode}
~ -1 + Mult(1, Inv(Const(1) + Exp(Mult(1 + offset(-x), Inv(1)))))
\end{Scode}
where \Rfunction{Const} is a convenience function to specify a constant in a
\Rclass{nonlin} term, equivalent to \Rcode{offset(rep(1, nObs))} where
\Robject{nObs} is the number of observations. However, this is rather convoluted
and it may be preferable to define a specialized \Rclass{nonlin} function in
such a case. Section \ref{sec:nonlin.functions} explains how users can define
custom \Rclass{nonlin} functions, with a function to specify logistic terms as
an example.

One family of models usefully specified with the basic functions is the
family of models with multiplicative interactions. For example, the row-column
association model
\[
\log \mu_{rc} = \alpha_r + \beta_c + \gamma_r\delta_c,
\]
also known as the Goodman RC model \citep{Good79}, would be specified
as a log-link model (for response variable \Robject{resp}, say), with formula
\begin{Scode}
resp ~ R + C + Mult(R, C)
\end{Scode}
where \Robject{R} and \Robject{C} are row and column factors respectively. In
some contexts, it may be desirable to constrain one or more of the constituent
multipliers\footnote{
A note on terminology: the rather cumbersome phrase `constituent multiplier', or
sometimes the abbreviation `multiplier', will
be used throughout this document in preference to the more elegant and standard
mathematical term `factor'.  This will avoid possible confusion with the
completely different meaning of the word `factor' --- that is, a categorical
variable --- in \R.
} in a multiplicative interaction to be nonnegative . This may be achieved by
specifying the multiplier as an exponential, as in the following `uniform
difference' model \citep{Xie92, Erik92}
\[
\log \mu_{rct} = \alpha_{rt} + \beta_{ct} + e^{\gamma_t}\delta_{rc},
\]
which would be represented by a formula of the form
\begin{Scode}
resp ~ R:T + C:T + Mult(Exp(T), R:C)
\end{Scode}

\subsection{\Rfunction{MultHomog}}

\Rfunction{MultHomog} is a \Rclass{nonlin} function to specify
multiplicative interaction terms in which the constituent
multipliers are the effects of two or more factors and the effects of these
factors are constrained to be equal when the factor levels are equal. The
arguments of \Rfunction{MultHomog} are the factors in the interaction,
which are
assumed to be objects of class \Rclass{factor}.

As an example, consider the following association model with homogeneous
row-column effects:
\[\log \mu_{rc} = \alpha_r + \beta_c + \theta_{r}I(r=c) + \gamma_r\gamma_c.\]
To fit this model, with response variable named \Robject{resp}, say,
the formula argument to \Rfunction{gnm} would be
\begin{Scode}
resp ~ R + C + Diag(R, C) + MultHomog(R, C)
\end{Scode}

If the factors passed to \Rfunction{MultHomog} do not have
exactly the same levels,
a common set of levels is obtained by taking the union of the levels of each
factor, sorted into increasing order.

\subsection{\Rfunction{Dref}}
\label{sec:Dref function}

\Rfunction{Dref} is a \Rclass{nonlin} function to fit diagonal reference terms
 \citep{Sobe81, Sobe85} involving
two or more factors with a common set of levels. A diagonal reference term
comprises an additive component for each factor. The component for factor $f$
is given by
\[
w_f\gamma_l
\]
for an observation with level $l$ of factor $f$, where $w_f$ is the weight for
factor $f$ and $\gamma_l$ is the ``diagonal effect'' for level $l$.

The weights are constrained to be nonnegative and to sum to one so that a
``diagonal effect'', say $\gamma_l$, is the value of the diagonal reference term
for data points with level $l$ across the factors. \Rfunction{Dref} specifies
the constraints on the weights by defining them as
\[
w_f = \frac{e^{\delta_f}}{\sum_i e^{\delta_i}}
\]
where the $\delta_f$ are the parameters to be estimated.

Factors defining the diagonal reference term
are passed as unspecified arguments to
\Rfunction{Dref}.  For example, the following diagonal reference model for
a contingency table classified by the row factor \Robject{R}
and the column factor \Robject{C},
\[
\mu_{rc} =\frac{e^{\delta_1}}{e^{\delta_1} + e^{\delta_2}}\gamma_r +
\frac{e^{\delta_2}}{e^{\delta_1} + e^{\delta_2}}\gamma_c,
\]
would be specified by a formula of the form
\begin{Scode}
resp ~ -1 + Dref(R, C)
\end{Scode}

The \Rfunction{Dref} function has one specified argument, \Rfunarg{delta},
which is a formula with no left-hand side, specifying the dependence (if any)
of $\delta_f$ on  covariates.
For example, the formula
\begin{Scode}
resp ~ -1 + x + Dref(R, C, delta = ~ 1 + x)
\end{Scode}
specifies the generalized diagonal reference model
\[
\mu_{rci} = \beta x_i + \frac{e^{\xi_{01} + \xi_{11}x_i}}{e^{\xi_{01} + \xi_{11}x_i} + e^{\xi_{02} + \xi_{12}x_i}}\gamma_r +
\frac{e^{\xi_{02} + \xi_{12}x_i}}{e^{\xi_{01} + \xi_{11}x_i} + e^{\xi_{02} + \xi_{12}x_i}}\gamma_c.
\]
The default value of \Rfunarg{delta} is \Robject{\twiddle 1}, so that
constant weights are estimated. The coefficients returned by \Rfunction{gnm} are
those that are directly estimated, i.e. the $\delta_f$ or the $\xi_{.f}$, rather
than the implied weights $w_f$. However, these weights may be obtained from a
fitted model using the \Rfunction{DrefWeights} function, which computes the
corresponding standard errors using the delta method.

\subsection{\Rfunction{instances}}
\label{sec:instances}

Multiple instances of a linear term will be aliased with each other, but this is
not necessarily the case for nonlinear terms. Indeed, there are certain types of
model where adding further instances of a nonlinear term is a natural way to extend
the model. For example, Goodman's RC model, introduced in section \ref{sec:Basic}
\[
\log \mu_{rc} = \alpha_r + \beta_c + \gamma_r\delta_c,
\]
is naturally extended to the RC(2) model, with a two-component interaction
\[
\log \mu_{rc} = \alpha_r + \beta_c + \gamma_r\delta_c + \theta_r\phi_c.
\]

Currently all of the \Rclass{nonlin} functions in \Rpackage{gnm} except
\Rpackage{Dref} have
an \Rfunarg{inst} argument to allow the specification of multiple instances. So the
RC(2) model could be specified as follows
\begin{Scode}
resp ~ R + C + Mult(R, C, inst = 1) + Mult(R, C, inst = 2)
\end{Scode}
The convenience function \Rfunction{instances} allows multiple instances of a
term to be specified at once
\begin{Scode}
resp ~ R + C + instances(Mult(R, C), 2)
\end{Scode}
The formula is expanded by \Rfunction{gnm}, so that the instances are treated as
separate terms. The \Rfunction{instances} function may be used with any function
with an \Rfunarg{inst} argument.

\subsection{Custom \Rclass{nonlin} functions}
\label{sec:nonlin.functions}

\subsubsection{General description}

Users may write their own \Rclass{nonlin} functions to specify nonlinear terms
which can not (easily) be specified using the \Rclass{nonlin} functions in the
\Rpackage{gnm} package. A function of class \Rclass{nonlin} should return a list
of arguments for the internal function \Rfunction{nonlinTerms}. The following
arguments must be specified in all cases:
\begin{description}
\setlength{\itemindent}{-0.5cm}
\item[\Robject{predictors}:] a list of symbolic expressions or formulae with no
    left hand side which represent (possibly nonlinear)
    predictors that form part of the term.
\item[\Robject{term}:] a function that takes the arguments \Rfunarg{predLabels}
    and \Rfunarg{varLabels}, which are labels generated by \Rfunction{gnm} for
    the specified predictors and variables (see below), and returns a deparsed
    mathematical expression of the nonlinear term.  Only functions recognised by
    \Rfunction{deriv} should be used in the expression, e.g. \Rfunction{+}
    rather than \Rfunction{sum}.
\end{description}
Intercepts are added by default to predictors that are specified by formulae.
If predictors are named, these names are used as a prefix for parameter labels
or as the parameter label itself in the single-parameter case.

The following arguments of \Rfunction{nonlinTerms} must be specified whenever
applicable to the nonlinear term:
\begin{description}
\setlength{\itemindent}{-0.5cm}
\item[\Robject{variables}:] a list of expressions representing variables in the term
    (variables with a coefficient of 1).
\item[\Robject{common}:] a numeric index of \Rfunarg{predictors} with
    duplicated indices identifying single factor predictors for which
    homologous effects are to be estimated.
\end{description}
The arguments below are optional:
\begin{description}
\setlength{\itemindent}{-0.5cm}
\item[\Robject{call}:] a call to be used as a prefix for parameter labels.
\item[\Robject{match}:] (if \Robject{call} is non-\Rcode{NULL}) a numeric index
    of \Robject{predictors} specifying which arguments of \Robject{call} the
    predictors match to --- zero indicating no match. If \Rcode{NULL},
    predictors will not be matched to the arguments of \Robject{call}.
\item[\Robject{start}:] a function which takes a named vector of parameters
    corresponding to the predictors and returns a vector of
    starting values for those parameters. This function is ignored if the
    term is nested within another nonlinear term.
\end{description}

Predictors which are matched to a specified argument of \Robject{call} should be
given the same name as the argument. Matched predictors are labelled using ``dot-style''
labelling, e.g. the label for the intercept in the first
constituent multiplier of the term \Rcode{Mult(A, B)} would be \Rcode{"Mult(.\ + A, 1 +
B).(Intercept)"}. It is recommended that matches are specified wherever
possible, to ensure parameter labels are well-defined.

The arguments of \Rclass{nonlin} functions are as suited to the particular term,
but will usually include symbolic representations of predictors in the term
and/or the names of variables in the term. The function may also have an
\Rfunarg{inst} argument to allow specification of multiple instances (see
\ref{sec:instances}).

\subsubsection{Example: a logistic function}

As an example, consider writing a \Rclass{nonlin} function for
the logistic term discussed in \ref{sec:Basic}:
\[\frac{\text{Asym}}{1 + \exp((\text{xmid} - x)/\text{scal})}.\]
We can consider \emph{Asym}, \emph{xmid} and \emph{scal}
as the parameters of three separate predictors,
each with a single intercept term. Thus we specify the \Rfunarg{predictors}
argument to \Rfunction{nonlinTerms} as
\begin{Scode}
predictors = list(Asym = 1, xmid = 1, scal = 1)
\end{Scode}
The term also depends on the variable $x$, which would need to be specified by
the user. Suppose this is specified to our \Rclass{nonlin} function through an
argument named \Rfunarg{x}. Then our \Rclass{nonlin} function would specify the
following \Rfunarg{variables} argument
\begin{Scode}
variables = list(substitute(x))
\end{Scode}
We need to use \Rfunction{substitute} here to list the variable specified by the user
rather than the variable named \Rcode{``x''} (if it exists).

Our \Rclass{nonlin} function must also specify the \Rfunarg{term} argument to
\Rfunction{nonlinTerms}. This is a function that will paste together an
expression for the term, given labels for the predictors and the variables:
\begin{Scode}
    term = function(predLabels, varLabels) {
      paste(predLabels[1], "/(1 + exp((", predLabels[2], "-",
      varLabels[1], ")/", predLabels[3], "))")
    }
\end{Scode}

We now have all the necessary ingredients of a \Rclass{nonlin} function to specify
the logistic term. Since the parameterization does not depend on user-specified
values, it does not make sense to use call-matched labelling in this case. The
labels for our parameters will be taken from the labels of the
\Rfunarg{predictors} argument. Since we do not anticipate fitting models with
multiple logistic terms, our \Rclass{nonlin} function will not specify a
\Rfunarg{call} argument with which to prefix the parameter labels. We do
however, have some idea of useful starting values, so we will specify the
\Rfunarg{start} argument as
\begin{Scode}
start = function(theta){
    theta[3] <- 1
    theta
}
\end{Scode}
which sets the initial scale parameter to one.

Putting all these ingredients together we have
\begin{Scode}
Logistic <- function(x){
    list(predictors = list(Asym = 1, xmid = 1, scal = 1),
         variables = list(substitute(x)),
         term = function(predLabels, varLabels) {
             paste(predLabels[1], "/(1 + exp((", predLabels[2], "-",
             varLabels[1], ")/", predLabels[3], "))")
         },
         start = function(theta){
             theta[3] <- 1
             theta
         })
}
class(Logistic) <- "nonlin"
\end{Scode}

\subsubsection{Example: \Rfunction{MultHomog}}

The \Rfunction{MultHomog} function included in the \Rpackage{gnm} package
provides a further example of a \Rclass{nonlin}
function, showing how to specify a term with quite different features from the
preceding example.  The definition is
\begin{Scode}
MultHomog <- function(..., inst = NULL){
    dots <- match.call(expand.dots = FALSE)[["..."]]
    list(predictors = dots,
         common = rep(1, length(dots)),
         term = function(predLabels, ...) {
             paste("(", paste(predLabels, collapse = ")*("), ")", sep = "")},
         call = as.expression(match.call()))
}
class(MultHomog) <- "nonlin"
\end{Scode}
Firstly, the interaction may be based on any number of factors, hence the use
of the special ``\Rfunarg{...}'' argument. The use of \Rfunction{match.call} is
analogous to the use of \Rfunction{substitute} in the \Rfunction{Logistic}
function: to obtain expressions for the factors as specified by the user.

The returned \Rfunarg{common} argument specifies that homogeneous effects are to
be estimated across all the specified factors. The term only depends on these
factors, but the \Rfunarg{term} function allows for the empty
\Robject{varLabels} vector that will be passed to it, by having a
``\Rfunarg{...}'' argument.

Since the user may wish to specify multiple instances, the \Rfunarg{call}
argument to \Rfunction{nonlinTerms} is specified, so that parameters in
different instances of the term will have unique labels (due to the
\Rfunarg{inst} argument in the call). However as the expressions passed to
``\Rfunarg{...}'' may only represent single factors, rather than
general predictors, it is not necessary to use call-matched labelling, so the
\Rfunarg{match} argument is not specified here.

% Dref starting values as example of ensuring the arbitrariness of the final
% parameterization is emphasised (see old plug-in section)?

\section{Controlling the fitting procedure}

The \Rfunction{gnm} function has a number of arguments which affect the way a
model will be fitted.  Basic control parameters can be set using the arguments
%\Rfunarg{checkLinear},
\Rfunarg{lsMethod}, \Rfunarg{ridge}, \Rfunarg{tolerance},
\Rfunarg{iterStart} and \Rfunarg{iterMax}. Starting values for the parameter
estimates can be set by \Rfunarg{start} or they can be generated from starting
values for the predictors on the link or response scale via \Rfunarg{etastart} or
\Rfunarg{mustart} respectively. Parameters can be constrained via
\Rfunarg{constrain} and \Rfunarg{constrainTo} arguments, while parameters of a
stratification factor can be handled more efficiently by specifying the factor
in an \Rfunarg{eliminate} argument. These options are described in more detail below.

\subsection{Basic control parameters}

%By default, \Rfunction{gnm} will use \Rfunction{glm.fit} to fit models where the
%predictor is linear and \Rfunarg{eliminate} is \Rcode{NULL}. This behaviour can
%be overridden by setting \Rfunarg{checkLinear} to \Rcode{FALSE}.
%%% At present there is no advantage to doing this! Parameterization would be
%%% the same.
The arguments \Rfunarg{iterStart} and \Rfunarg{iterMax} control respectively the
number of starting iterations (where applicable) and the number of main
iterations used by the fitting algorithm. The progress of these iterations can
be followed by setting either \Rfunarg{verbose} or \Rfunarg{trace} to \Robject{TRUE}.
If \Rfunarg{verbose} is \Robject{TRUE} and \Rfunarg{trace} is \Robject{FALSE},
which is the default setting, progress is indicated by printing the character
``.'' at the beginning of each iteration.  If \Rfunarg{trace} is \Robject{TRUE},
the deviance is printed at the beginning of each iteration (over-riding the
printing of ``.'' if necessary). Whenever \Rfunarg{verbose} is \Robject{TRUE},
additional messages indicate each stage of the fitting process and diagnose any
errors that cause that cause the algorithm to restart.

The \Rfunarg{lsMethod} argument specifies what numerical
     method is to be used to solve the (typically rank-deficient) least
     squares problem at the heart of the \Rfunction{gnm} fitting algorithm: the
     options are  direct solution using a QR decomposition (\Rcode{``qr''}),
     and matrix inversion via Cholesky decomposition (\Rcode{``chol''}).  In
     both cases, the design matrix is standardized and regularized (in
     the Levenberg-Marquardt sense) prior to solving; the \Rfunarg{ridge}
     argument provides a degree of control over the regularization
     performed (smaller values may sometimes give faster convergence
     but can lead to numerical instability).  If \Rfunarg{lsMethod} is left
     unspecified, the default is \Rcode{``qr''}, unless \Rfunarg{eliminate}
     is used in
     which case the default \Rfunarg{lsMethod} used is \Rcode{``chol''}.

The fitting algorithm will terminate before the number of main iterations has
reached \Rfunarg{iterMax} if the convergence criteria have been met, with
tolerance specified by \Rfunarg{tolerance}. Convergence is judged by comparing
the squared components of the score vector with corresponding elements of the
diagonal of the Fisher information matrix. If, for all components of the score
vector, the ratio is less than \Robject{tolerance\^{}2},
or the corresponding diagonal
element of the Fisher information matrix is less than 1e-20, the algorithm is
deemed to have converged.

\subsection{Specifying starting values}
\label{sec:start}

\subsubsection{Using \Rfunarg{start}}

In some contexts, the default starting values may not be appropriate and the
fitting algorithm will fail to converge, or perhaps only converge after a large number
of iterations. Alternative starting values may be passed on to \Rfunction{gnm}
by specifying a \Rfunarg{start} argument. This should be a numeric vector of
length equal to the number of parameters (or possibly the non-eliminated
parameters, see Section \ref{sec:eliminate}), however missing starting values
(\Robject{NA}s) are allowed.

If there is no user-specified starting value for a parameter, the
default value is used. This feature is particularly useful when adding terms to
a model, since the estimates from the original model can be used as starting
values, as in this example:
\begin{Scode}
model1 <- gnm(mu ~ R + C + Mult(R, C))
model2 <- gnm(mu ~ R + C + instances(Mult(R, C), 2),
              start = c(coef(model1), rep(NA, 10)))
\end{Scode}
The \Rfunction{gnm} call can be made with \Rcode{method = "coefNames"} to
identify the parameters of a model prior to estimation, to assist with the
specification of arguments such as \Rfunarg{start}.  For example, to get the number \Rcode{10} for the value of \Rfunarg{start} above, we could have done
\begin{Scode}
gnm(mu ~ R + C + instances(Mult(R, C), 2), method = "coefNames")
\end{Scode}
from whose output it would be seen that there are 10 new coefficients in
\Robject{model2}.  When called with \Rcode{method = "coefNames"},
\Rfunction{gnm} makes no attempt to fit the specified model;
instead it returns just the
names that the coefficients in the fitted model object would have.

The starting procedure used by \Rfunction{gnm} is as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
Begin with all parameters set to \Rcode{NA}.
\item
\label{i:nonlin}
Replace \Rcode{NA} values with any starting values set by
\Rclass{nonlin} functions.
\item
\label{i:start}
Replace current values with any (non-\Rcode{NA}) starting values specified by
the \Rfunarg{start} argument of \Rfunction{gnm}.
\item
\label{i:constrain}
Set any values specified by the \Rfunarg{constrain} argument to the values
specified by the \Rfunarg{constrainTo} argument (see Section \ref{sec:constrain}).
\item
\label{i:gnmStart}
Categorise remaining \Rcode{NA} parameters as linear or nonlinear, treating
non-\Rcode{NA} parameters as fixed. Initialise the nonlinear parameters by
generating values $\theta_i$ from the Uniform($-0.1$, $0.1$) distribution and
shifting these values away from zero as follows
\begin{equation*}
\theta_i = \begin{cases}
    \theta_i - 0.1 &  \text{if } \theta_i < 1 \\
    \theta_i + 0.1 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{equation*}
\item
Compute the \Rfunction{glm} estimate of the linear parameters, offsetting the
contribution to the predictor of any terms fully determined by steps
\ref{i:nonlin} to \ref{i:gnmStart}.
\item
\label{i:iter}
Run starting iterations: update nonlinear parameters one at a time, jointly
re-estimating linear parameters after each round of updates.
\end{enumerate}
Note that no starting iterations (step \ref{i:iter}) will be run if all parameters are
linear, or if all nonlinear parameters are specified by \Rfunarg{start},
\Rfunarg{constrain} or a \Rclass{nonlin} function.

\subsubsection{Using \Rfunarg{etastart} or \Rfunarg{mustart}}

An alternative way to set starting values for the parameters is to specify
starting values for the predictors.

If there are linear parameters in the model, the predictor starting values are
first used to fit a model with only the linear terms (offsetting any terms that
are constrained). In this case the parameters corresponding to the predictor
starting values can be computed analytically. If the fitted model reproduces
the predictor starting values, then these values contain no further information
and they are replaced using the \Rfunction{initialize} function of the specified
\Rfunarg{family}.

The predictor starting values or their replacement are then used as the response
variable in a nonlinear least squares model with only the nonlinear terms,
offsetting the fitted linear predictors. Since the model is over-parameterized,
the model is approximated using \Rfunarg{iterStart} iterations of the
``L-BFGS-B'' algorithm of \Rfunction{optim}, assuming parameters lie in the
range (-10, 10).

Starting values for the predictors can be specified explicitly via
\Rfunarg{etastart} or implicitly by passing starting values for the fitted
means to \Rfunarg{mustart}. For example, when extending a model, the fitted
predictors from the first model can be used to find starting values for the
parameters of the second model:
\begin{Scode}
model1 <- gnm(mu ~ R + C + Mult(R, C))
model2 <- gnm(mu ~ R + C + instances(Mult(R, C), 2),
              etastart = model1$predictors)
\end{Scode}
%$
Using \Rfunction{etastart} avoids the one-parameter-at-a-time starting
iterations, so is quicker than using \Rfunction{start} to pass on information
from a nested model. However \Rfunction{start} will generally produce better
starting values so should be used when feasible. For multiplicative terms, the
\Rfunction{residSVD} functions provides a better way to avoid starting iterations.

\subsection{Using \Rfunarg{constrain}}
\label{sec:constrain}

By default, \Rfunction{gnm} only imposes identifiability constraints according
to the general conventions used by \Robject{R} to handle linear aliasing. Therefore
models that have any nonlinear terms will be typically be over-parameterized,
and \Rfunction{gnm} will return a random parameterization for unidentified
coefficients (determined by the randomly chosen starting values for the iterative algorithm, step 5 above).

To illustrate this point, consider the following application of \Rfunction{gnm},
discussed later in Section \ref{sec:RCmodels}:
<<RC_homogeneous_model_1>>=
data(occupationalStatus)
set.seed(1)
RChomog1 <- gnm(Freq ~ origin + destination + Diag(origin, destination) +
               MultHomog(origin, destination), family = poisson,
               data = occupationalStatus, verbose = FALSE)
@
Running the analysis again from a different seed
<<RC_homogeneous_model_2>>=
set.seed(2)
RChomog2 <- update(RChomog1)
@
gives a different representation of the same model:
<<Compare_coefficients>>=
compareCoef <- cbind(coef(RChomog1), coef(RChomog2))
colnames(compareCoef) <- c("RChomog1", "RChomog2")
round(compareCoef, 4)
@
Even though the linear terms are constrained, the parameter estimates for the
main effects of \Robject{origin} and \Robject{destination} still change, because
these terms are aliased with the higher order multiplicative interaction, which
is unconstrained.

Standard errors are only meaningful for identified parameters and hence the
output of \Rmethod{summary.gnm} will show clearly which coefficients are
estimable:
<<Summarize_model>>=
summary(RChomog2)
@

Additional constraints may be specified through the \Rfunarg{constrain} and
\Rfunarg{constrainTo} arguments of \Rfunction{gnm}. These arguments specify
respectively parameters that are to be constrained in the fitting process and
the values to which they should be constrained. Parameters may be specified by a
regular expression to match against the parameter names, a numeric vector of
indices, a character vector of names, or, if \Rcode{constrain = "[?]"} they can
be selected through a \emph{Tk} dialog. The values to constrain to should be
specified by a numeric vector; if \Rfunarg{constrainTo} is missing, constrained
parameters will be set to zero.

In the case above, constraining one level of the homogeneous multiplicative
factor is sufficient to make the parameters of the nonlinear term
identifiable, and hence all parameters in the model identifiable. For example,
setting the last level of the homogeneous multiplicative factor to zero,
<<RC_homogeneous_constrained_model>>=
multCoef <- coef(RChomog1)[pickCoef(RChomog1, "Mult")]
set.seed(1)
RChomogConstrained1 <- update(RChomog1, constrain = 31,
                              start = c(rep(NA, 23), multCoef - multCoef[8]))
set.seed(2)
RChomogConstrained2 <- update(RChomogConstrained1)
identical(coef(RChomogConstrained1), coef(RChomogConstrained2))
@
gives the same results regardless of the random seed set beforehand.

It is not usually so straightforward to constrain all the parameters in a
generalized nonlinear model. However use of \Rfunarg{constrain} in conjunction
with \Rfunarg{constrainTo} is usually sufficient to make coefficients of
interest identifiable . The functions \Rfunction{checkEstimable} or
\Rfunction{getContrasts}, described in Section \ref{sec:Methods},
may be used to check whether particular combinations of parameters
are estimable.

\subsection{Using \Rfunarg{eliminate}}
\label{sec:eliminate}

When a model contains the additive effect of a factor which has a large
number of levels, the iterative algorithm by which maximum likelihood estimates
are computed can usually
be accelerated by use of the \Rfunarg{eliminate} argument to \Rfunction{gnm}.

The factor to be \Rfunarg{eliminate}-d should be specified by an expression,
which is then
interpreted as the first term in the model formula, replacing any intercept
term. So, for example, in terms of the structure of the model,
\begin{Scode}
gnm(mu ~ A + B + Mult(A, B), eliminate = strata1:strata2)
\end{Scode}
is equivalent to
\begin{Scode}
gnm(mu ~ -1 + strata1:strata2 + A + B + Mult(A, B))
\end{Scode}
However, specifying a factor through \Rfunarg{eliminate} has two
advantages over the standard specification. First, the structure of the
eliminated factor is exploited so that computational speed is
improved ---
substantially so if the number of eliminated parameters is large.
Second, unless
otherwise specified through the \Rfunarg{ofInterest} argument to
\Rfunction{gnm},
the \Robject{ofInterest} component of the returned model object
indexes the non-eliminated parameters. Thus eliminated parameters are excluded
from printed model summaries and default selection by \Rclass{gnm} methods. See
Section \ref{sec:ofInterest} for further details on the use of the
\Robject{ofInterest} component.

The \Rfunarg{eliminate} feature is useful, for example, when
multinomial-response models are fitted by using the well known equivalence
between multinomial and (conditional) Poisson likelihoods.  In such situations
the sufficient statistic involves a potentially large number of fixed
multinomial row totals, and the corresponding parameters are of no
substantive interest.  For an application see Section \ref{sec:Stereotype} below.
Here we give an artificial illustration: 1000 randomly-generated trinomial
responses, and a single predictor variable (whose effect on the data generation
is null):
<<Eliminate_Eg>>=
set.seed(1)
n <- 1000
x <- rep(rnorm(n), rep(3, n))
counts <- as.vector(rmultinom(n, 10, c(0.7, 0.1, 0.2)))
rowID <- gl(n, 3, 3 * n)
resp <- gl(3, 1, 3 * n)
@
The logistic model for dependence on \Robject{x} can be fitted as a Poisson
log-linear model\footnote{For this particular example, of course, it would be
more economical to fit the model directly using \Rfunction{multinom} (from the
recommended package \Rpackage{nnet}).  But fitting as here via the
`Poisson trick' allows the model to be elaborated within the \Rpackage{gnm}
framework using \Rfunction{Mult} or other \Rclass{nonlin} terms.}, using
either \Rfunction{glm} or \Rfunction{gnm}:
\begin{Sinput}
> ## Timings on a Pentium M 1.6GHz, under Linux
> system.time(temp.glm <- glm(counts ~ rowID + resp + resp:x,
                              family = poisson))[1]
\end{Sinput}
\begin{Soutput}
[1] 121.007
\end{Soutput}
\begin{Sinput}
> system.time(temp.gnm <- gnm(counts ~ resp + resp:x, eliminate = rowID,
                              family = poisson, verbose = FALSE))[1]
\end{Sinput}
\begin{Soutput}
[1] 19.985
\end{Soutput}
\begin{Sinput}
> c(deviance(temp.glm), deviance(temp.gnm))
\end{Sinput}
\begin{Soutput}
[1] 2462.556 2462.556
\end{Soutput}
Here the use of \Rfunarg{eliminate} causes the \Rfunction{gnm} calculations to
run more quickly than \Rfunction{glm}.  The speed advantage\footnote{In fact
\Rfunarg{eliminate} is, in principle, capable of much bigger time savings
than this: its
implementation in the current version of \Rpackage{gnm} is really just a proof
of concept, and it has not yet been optimized for speed.} increases with
the number of eliminated parameters (here 1000).
Since the default behaviour has not been over-ridden
by an \Rfunarg{ofInterest} argument, the eliminated parameters do
not appear in printed model summaries:
\begin{Sinput}
> summary(temp.gnm)
\end{Sinput}
\begin{Soutput}
Call:

gnm(formula = counts ~ resp + resp:x, eliminate = rowID, family = poisson,
    verbose = FALSE)


Deviance Residuals:
      Min         1Q     Median         3Q        Max

(Dispersion parameter for poisson family taken to be 1)

Std. Error is NA where coefficient has been constrained or is unidentified

Residual deviance: 2462.6 on 1996 degrees of freedom
AIC: 12028

Number of iterations: 3
\end{Soutput}
As usual, \Rfunction{gnm} has worked here with an over-parameterized
representation of the model.  The parameterization used by \Rfunction{glm}
can be seen from
\begin{Sinput}
> coef(temp.glm)[-(1:1000)]
\end{Sinput}
\begin{Soutput}
   resp2    resp3  resp1:x  resp2:x  resp3:x
-1.96145 -1.25585 -0.00773 -0.02334       NA
\end{Soutput}
(we will not print the full summary of \Robject{temp.glm} here, since it gives
details of all 1005 parameters!), which easily can be obtained, if required,
by using \Rfunction{getContrasts}:
\begin{Sinput}
> getContrasts(temp.gnm, ofInterest(temp.gnm)[5:3])
\end{Sinput}
\begin{Soutput}

resp1:x -0.00773 0.02452 0.01154 0.000133
\end{Soutput}
See Section \ref{sec:getContrasts} for further details of the
\Rfunction{getContrasts} function.

The \Rfunarg{eliminate} feature as implemented in \Rpackage{gnm} extends the
earlier work of \cite{Hatz04} to a broader class of models and to
over-parameterized model representations.

\section{Methods and accessor functions}
\label{sec:Methods}

\subsection{Methods}
\label{sec:specificMethods}

The \Rfunction{gnm} function returns
an object of class \Robject{c("gnm", "glm", "lm")}. There
are several methods that have been written for objects of class \Rclass{glm}
or \Rclass{lm} to facilitate inspection of fitted models.
Out of the generic functions in the \Rpackage{base},
\Rpackage{stats} and \Rpackage{graphics} packages for which methods have been
written
for \Rclass{glm} or \Rclass{lm} objects, Figure \ref{fig:glm.lm} shows those
that can be used to analyse \Rclass{gnm} objects, whilst Figure
\ref{fig:!glm.lm} shows
those that are not implemented for \Rclass{gnm} objects.

      implemented for \Rclass{gnm} objects.}
    \label{fig:!glm.lm}
\end{figure}

In addition to the accessor functions shown in Figure \ref{fig:glm.lm}, the
\Rpackage{gnm} package provides a new generic function called
\Rfunction{termPredictors}
that has methods for objects of class \Rclass{gnm}, \Rclass{glm} and
\Rclass{lm}. This function returns the additive contribution of each term to
the predictor.  See Section \ref{sec:termPredictors} for an example of its use.

Most of the functions listed in Figure \ref{fig:glm.lm} can be used as they would be
for \Rclass{glm} or \Rclass{lm} objects, however care must be taken with
\Rmethod{vcov.gnm}, as the variance-covariance matrix will depend on the
parameterization of the model. In particular, standard errors calculated using
the variance-covariance matrix will only be valid for parameters or contrasts
that are estimable!

Similarly, \Rmethod{profile.gnm} and \Rmethod{confint.gnm} are only applicable
to estimable parameters. The deviance function of a generalized nonlinear model
can sometimes be far from quadratic and \Rmethod{profile.gnm} attempts to detect
assymetry or asymptotic behaviour in order to return a sufficient profile for a
given parameter. As an example, consider the following model, described later in
Section \ref{sec:Unidiff}:

\begin{Scode}
data(yaish)
unidiff <- gnm(Freq ~ educ*orig + educ*dest + Mult(Exp(educ), orig:dest),
               constrain = "[.]educ1", family = poisson, data = yaish,
               subset = (dest != 7))
prof <- profile(unidiff, which = 61:65, trace = TRUE)
\end{Scode}

If the deviance is quadratic in a given parameter, the profile trace will be
linear. We can plot the profile traces as follows:

\begin{figure}[!tbph]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{fig-profilePlot.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{Profile traces for the multipliers of the orig:dest association}
\label{fig:profilePlot}
\end{figure}

From these plots we can see that the deviance is approximately quadratic
in \Robject{Mult(Exp(.), orig:dest).educ2}, assymetric in
\Robject{Mult(Exp(.), orig:dest).educ3} and \Robject{Mult(Exp(.),
  orig:dest).educ4} and asymptotic in \Robject{Mult(Exp(.), orig:dest).educ5}.
When the deviance is approximately quadratic in a given parameter,
\Rmethod{profile.gnm} uses the same stepsize for profiling above and below the
original estimate:

\begin{Sinput}
> diff(prof[[2]]$par.vals[, "Mult(Exp(.), orig:dest).educ2"])
\end{Sinput}
\begin{Soutput}
 [1] 0.1053072 0.1053072 0.1053072 0.1053072 0.1053072 0.1053072 0.1053072
 [8] 0.1053072 0.1053072 0.1053072
\end{Soutput}

When the deviance is assymmetric, \Rmethod{profile.gnm} uses different
stepsizes to accommodate the skew:
\begin{Sinput}
> diff(prof[[4]]$par.vals[, "Mult(Exp(.), orig:dest).educ4"])
\end{Sinput}
\begin{Soutput}
 [1] 0.2018393 0.2018393 0.2018393 0.2018393 0.2018393 0.2018393 0.2018393
 [8] 0.2018393 0.2018393 0.2243673 0.2243673 0.2243673 0.2243673 0.2243673
\end{Soutput}

Finally, the presence of an asymptote is recorded in the \Robject{"asymptote"}
attribute of the returned profile:
\begin{Sinput}
> attr(prof[[5]], "asymptote")
\end{Sinput}
\begin{Soutput}
[1]  TRUE FALSE
\end{Soutput}

This information is used by \Rmethod{confint.gnm} to return infinite limits for
confidence intervals, as appropriate:
\begin{Sinput}
> confint(prof, level = 0.95)
\end{Sinput}
\begin{Soutput}
                                   2.5 %     97.5 %
Mult(Exp(.), orig:dest).educ1         NA         NA
Mult(Exp(.), orig:dest).educ2 -0.5978901  0.1022447
Mult(Exp(.), orig:dest).educ3 -1.4836854 -0.2362378
Mult(Exp(.), orig:dest).educ4 -2.5792398 -0.2953420
Mult(Exp(.), orig:dest).educ5       -Inf -0.7006889
\end{Soutput}

\subsection{\Rfunction{ofInterest} and \Rfunction{pickCoef}}
\label{sec:ofInterest}

It is quite common for a statistical model to have a large number of
parameters, but for only a subset of these parameters be of interest when it
comes to interpreting the model. An example of this has been seen in
Section~\ref{sec:eliminate}, where a factor is required in the model in order
to represent
a structural aspect of the data, but the estimated factor effects have no
substantive interpretation. Even for models in which all parameters
correspond to variables of potential interest, the substantive focus
may still be on a subset of
parameters.

The \Rfunarg{ofInterest} argument to \Rfunction{gnm} allows the user to specify
a subset of the parameters which are of interest, so that \Rclass{gnm} methods
will focus on these parameters. In particular, printed model summaries will only
show the parameters of interest, whilst methods for which a subset of parameters
may be selected will by default select the parameters of interest, or where this
may not be appropriate, provide a \emph{Tk} dialog for selection from the parameters of
interest. Parameters may be specified to the \Rfunarg{ofInterest} argument by a
regular expression to match against parameter names, by a numeric vector of
indices, by a character vector of names, or, if \Rcode{ofInterest = "[?]"}
they can
be selected through a \emph{Tk} dialog.

The information regarding the parameters of interest is held in the
\Robject{ofInterest} component of \Rclass{gnm} objects, which is a named vector
of numeric indices, or \Robject{NULL} if all parameters are of interest. This
component may be accessed or replaced using \Rfunction{ofInterest} or
\Rfunction{ofInterest<-} respectively.

The \Rfunction{pickCoef} function provides a simple way to obtain the indices of
coefficients from any model object. It takes the model object as its first
argument and has an optional \Rfunarg{regexp} argument. If a regular expression
is passed to \Rfunarg{regexp}, the coefficients are selected by matching this
regular expression against the coefficient names.
Otherwise, coefficients may be selected via a \emph{Tk} dialog.

So, returning to the example from the last section, if we had set
\Robject{ofInterest} to index the education multipliers as follows
\begin{Scode}
ofInterest(unidiff) <- pickCoef(unidiff, "[.]educ")
\end{Scode}
then it would not have been necessary to specify the \Rfunarg{which} argument of
\Rfunction{profile} as these parameters would have been selected by default.


\subsection{\Rfunction{checkEstimable}}
\label{sec:checkEstimable}

The \Rfunction{checkEstimable} function can be used to check the
estimability of a linear combination of parameters.  For non-linear
combinations the same function can be used to check estimability based on
the (local) vector of partial derivatives.  The \Rfunction{checkEstimable}
function provides a numerical version of the sort of algebraic test
described in \citet{CatcMorg97}.

Consider the following model, which is described later in Section
\ref{sec:Unidiff}:
<<Double_UNIDIFF_model>>=
data(cautres)
doubleUnidiff <- gnm(Freq ~ election:vote + election:class:religion
                     + Mult(Exp(election), religion:vote) +
                     Mult(Exp(election), class:vote), family = poisson,
                     data = cautres)
@
The effects of the first constituent multiplier in the first multiplicative
interaction are identified when the parameter for one of the levels --- say for the first level --- is
constrained to zero. The parameters to be
estimated are then the differences between each other level and the
first. These differences can be represented by a contrast matrix as
follows:
<<Contrast_matrix>>=
coefs <- names(coef(doubleUnidiff))
contrCoefs <- coefs[grep(", religion:vote", coefs)]
nContr <- length(contrCoefs)
contrMatrix <- matrix(0, length(coefs), nContr,
                      dimnames = list(coefs, contrCoefs))
contr <- contr.sum(contrCoefs)
# switch round to contrast with first level
contr <- rbind(contr[nContr, ], contr[-nContr, ])
contrMatrix[contrCoefs, 2:nContr] <- contr
contrMatrix[contrCoefs, 2:nContr]
@
Then their estimability can be checked using \Rfunction{checkEstimable}
<<Check_estimability_1>>=
checkEstimable(doubleUnidiff, contrMatrix)
@
which confirms that the effects for the other three levels are estimable when
the parameter for the first level is set to zero.

However, applying the equivalent constraint to the second constituent
multiplier in the interaction is not sufficient to make the parameters in that
multiplier estimable:
<<Check_estimability_2>>=
coefs <- names(coef(doubleUnidiff))
contrCoefs <- coefs[grep("[.]religion", coefs)]
nContr <- length(contrCoefs)
contrMatrix <- matrix(0, length(coefs), length(contrCoefs),
                      dimnames = list(coefs, contrCoefs))
contr <- contr.sum(contrCoefs)
contrMatrix[contrCoefs, 2:nContr] <- rbind(contr[nContr, ], contr[-nContr, ])
checkEstimable(doubleUnidiff, contrMatrix)
@

\subsection{\Rfunction{getContrasts}, \Rfunction{se}}
\label{sec:getContrasts}

To investigate simple ``sum to zero'' contrasts such as those above, it
is easiest to use the \Rfunction{getContrasts} function, which checks the
estimability of possibly scaled contrasts and returns the parameter estimates
with their standard errors. Returning to the example of the first constituent
multiplier in the first multiplicative interaction term, the differences between
each election and the first can be obtained as follows:
<<Get_contrasts_1>>=
myContrasts <- getContrasts(doubleUnidiff,
                            pickCoef(doubleUnidiff, ", religion:vote"))
myContrasts
@ %def
Visualization of estimated contrasts using
`quasi standard errors' \citep{Firt03,FirtMene04} is achieved by plotting
the resulting object:
<<qvplot, fig = TRUE, include = FALSE>>=
plot(myContrasts,
  main = "Relative strength of religion-vote association, log scale",
xlab = "Election", levelNames = 1:4)
@
\begin{figure}[!tbph]
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics{gnmOverview-qvplot.pdf}
    \end{center}
    \caption{Relative strength of religion-vote association, log scale}
    \label{fig:qvplot}
\end{figure}
%Attempting to obtain the equivalent contrasts for the second
%(religion-vote association) multiplier produces the
%following result:
%<<Get_contrasts_2>>=
%coefs.of.interest <- grep("[.]religion", names(coef(doubleUnidiff)))
%getContrasts(doubleUnidiff, coefs.of.interest)
%@ %def
By default, \Rfunction{getContrasts} uses the first parameter of the specified
set as the reference level; alternatives may be set via the \Rfunarg{ref}
argument.

In the above example, the simple contrasts are estimable without scaling. In
certain other applications, for example row-column association models (see
Section~\ref{sec:RCmodels}), the contrasts are identified only after fixing
their scale.  A more general family of \emph{scaled} contrasts for a set of
parameters $\gamma_r, r = 1, \ldots, R$ is given by
\begin{equation*}
    \gamma^*_r = \frac{\gamma_r - \overline{\gamma}_w}{
      \sqrt{\sum_r v_r  (\gamma_r - \overline{\gamma}_u)^2}}
\end{equation*}
where $\overline{\gamma}_w = \sum w_r \gamma_r$ is the reference level against
which the contrasts are taken, $\overline{\gamma}_u = \sum u_r \gamma_r$
is a possibly different
weighted mean of the parameters to be used as reference level for a set
of ``scaling contrasts'', and $v_r$ is a further
set of weights. Thus, for example, the choice
\[
w_r=
\begin{cases}
1&(r=1)\\
0&\hbox{(otherwise)}
\end{cases},
\qquad
u_r=v_r=1/R
\]
specifies contrasts with the first level, with the coefficients scaled to have
variance 1\null.
This general type of
scaling can be obtained by specifying the form of
$\overline{\gamma}_u$ and $v_r$
via the \Rfunarg{scaleRef} and \Rfunarg{scaleWeights} arguments of
\Rfunction{getContrasts}.

As an example, consider the following model, described in Section~\ref{sec:RCmodels}:
@
<<RCmodel>>=
data(mentalHealth)
mentalHealth$MHS <- C(mentalHealth$MHS, treatment)
mentalHealth$SES <- C(mentalHealth$SES, treatment)
RC1model <- gnm(count ~ SES + MHS + Mult(SES, MHS),
                family = poisson, data = mentalHealth)
@ %def
The effects of the constituent multipliers of the multiplicative interaction are
identified when both their scale and location are constrained. A simple way to
achieve this is to set the first parameter to zero and the last parameter to one:
@
<<RCmodel_constrained>>=
RC1model2 <- gnm(count ~ SES + MHS + Mult(1, SES, MHS),
                 constrain = "[.]SES[AF]", constrainTo = c(0, 1),
                 ofInterest = "[.]SES",
                 family = poisson, data = mentalHealth)
summary(RC1model2)
@ %def
Note that a constant multiplier must be incorporated into the interaction term,
i.e., the multiplicative
term \Rcode{Mult(SES, MHS)} becomes \Rcode{Mult(1, SES, MHS)},
in order
to maintain equivalence with the original model specification. The constraints
specified for \Robject{RC1model2} result in the estimation of
scaled contrasts with level \Rcode{A} of \Rcode{SES}, in which the scaling
fixes the magnitude of the contrast between   level \Rcode{F} and
level \Rcode{A} to be equal to 1\null.
The equivalent use of \Rfunction{getContrasts}, together
with the \emph{unconstrained} fit (\Robject{RC1model}),
in this case is as follows:
@
<<getContrasts_simple>>=
getContrasts(RC1model, pickCoef(RC1model, "[.]SES"), ref = "first",
             scaleRef = "first", scaleWeights = c(rep(0, 5), 1))
@ %def
Quasi-variances and standard errors are not returned here as they can not
(currently) be computed for scaled contrasts. When the scaling uses the same
reference level as the contrasts, equal scale weights produce ``spherical''
contrasts, whilst unequal weights produce ``elliptical''
contrasts. Further examples
are given in Sections~\ref{sec:RCmodels} and \ref{sec:GAMMI}.

For more general linear combinations of parameters
than contrasts,
the lower-level \Rfunction{se} function (which is called internally by
\Rfunction{getContrasts} and by the \Rmethod{summary} method)
can be used directly.  See \Rcode{help(se)} for details.

\subsection{\Rfunction{residSVD}}
\label{sec:residSVD}
Sometimes it is useful to operate on the residuals of a model in order
to create informative summaries of residual variation, or to obtain good
starting values for additional parameters in a more elaborate model.  The
relevant arithmetical operations are weighted means of the so-called
\emph{working residuals}.

The \Rfunction{residSVD} function facilitates one particular residual
analysis that is often useful when considering multiplicative interaction
between factors as a model elaboration: in effect, \Rfunction{residSVD}
provides a direct estimate of the parameters of such an interaction, by
performing an appropriately weighted singular value decomposition on the
working residuals.

As an illustration, consider the biplot model described in
Section~\ref{sec:biplot} below.  We can proceed by fitting a smaller model,
then use \Rfunction{residSVD} to obtain starting values for the parameters
in the bilinear term:
@
<<residSVD>>=
emptyModel <- gnm(y ~ -1, family = wedderburn, data = barley)
biplotStart <- residSVD(emptyModel, barley$site, barley$variety, d = 2)
biplotModel <- gnm(y ~ -1 + instances(Mult(site, variety), 2),
family = wedderburn, data = barley, start =  biplotStart)
@ %def
In this instance, the
use of purposive (as opposed to the default, random) starting values
had little effect: the fairly large number of iterations needed in this
example is caused by a rather flat (quasi-)likelihood surface near the
maximum, not by
poor starting values.  In other situations, the use of \Rfunction{residSVD}
may speed the calculations dramatically (see for example Section
\ref{sec:GAMMI}), or it may be crucial to success in
locating the MLE (for example see \Rcode{help(House2001)}, where
the number of multiplicative parameters is in the hundreds).

The \Rfunction{residSVD} result in this instance
provides a crude approximation to the MLE
of the enlarged model, as can be seen in \ref{fig:residSVDplot}:

@
<<residSVDplot, fig = TRUE, include = FALSE, echo = FALSE>>=
plot(coef(biplotModel), biplotStart,
     main = "Comparison of residSVD and MLE for a 2-dimensional
 biplot model")
@ %def

    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics{gnmOverview-residSVDplot}
    \end{center}
    \caption{Comparison of residSVD and the MLE for a 2-dimensional biplot
      model}
    \label{fig:residSVDplot}
\end{figure}


\section{\Rfunction{gnm} or \Rfunction{(g)nls}?}
\label{sec:gnmVnls}

The \Rfunction{nls} function in the \Rpackage{stats} package may be used to fit
a nonlinear model via least-squares estimation. Statistically speaking,
\Rfunction{gnm} is to \Rfunction{nls} as \Rfunction{glm} is to \Rfunction{lm},
in that a nonlinear least-squares model is equivalent to a
generalized nonlinear model with \Rcode{family = gaussian}.
A \Rfunction{nls} model assumes that the responses are
distributed either with constant variance or with fixed relative variances
(specified via the \Rfunarg{weights} argument).
The \Rfunction{gnls} function in
the \Rpackage{nlme} package extends \Rfunction{nls}
to allow correlated responses.
On the other hand, \Rfunction{gnm} allows for responses distributed with
variances that are a specified (via the \Rfunarg{family} argument) function of
the mean; as with \Rfunction{nls}, no correlation is allowed.

The \Rfunction{gnm} function also differs from \Rfunction{nls}/\Rfunction{gnls}
in terms of the interface. Models are specified to \Rfunction{nls} and
\Rfunction{gnls} in terms of a mathematical formula or a \Rclass{selfStart}
function based on such a formula, which is convenient for models that have a
small number of parameters. For models that have a large
number of parameters, or can not easily be represented by a mathematical
formula, the symbolic model specification used by \Rfunction{gnm} may be more
convenient. This would usually be the case for models involving factors, which
would need to be represented by dummy variables in a \Rfunction{nls}
formula.

When working with artificial data, \Rfunction{gnm} has the
minor advantage that it does not fail when a model is an exact fit to the
data (see \Rcode{help(nls)})\null.
Therefore it is not necessary with \Rfunction{gnm}
to add noise to artificial data, which can
be useful when testing methods.

\section{Examples}
\label{sec:Examples}

\subsection{Row-column association models}
\label{sec:RCmodels}

There are several models that have been proposed for modelling the relationship
between the cell means of a contingency table and the cross-classifying
factors. The following examples consider the row-column association models
proposed by \citet{Good79}. The examples shown use data from two-way contingency
tables, but the \Rpackage{gnm} package can also be used to fit the equivalent
models for higher order tables.

\subsubsection{RC(1) model}

The RC(1) model is a row and column association model with the interaction
between row and column factors represented by one component of the
multiplicative
interaction. If the rows are indexed by $r$ and the columns by $c$, then the
log-multiplicative form of the RC(1) model for the cell means $\mu_{rc}$ is
given by
\[\log \mu_{rc} = \alpha_r + \beta_c + \gamma_r\delta_c. \]

We shall fit this model to the \Robject{mentalHealth} data set from
\citet[][page 381]{Agre02}, which is a two-way contingency table classified
by the child's
mental impairment (MHS) and the parents' socioeconomic status (SES). Although
both of these factors are ordered, we do not wish to use polynomial contrasts
in the model, so we begin by setting the contrasts attribute of these
factors to \Rcode{treatment}:
<<Set_contrasts_attribute>>=
set.seed(1)
data(mentalHealth)
mentalHealth$MHS <- C(mentalHealth$MHS, treatment)
mentalHealth$SES <- C(mentalHealth$SES, treatment)
@
The \Rclass{gnm} model is then specified as follows, using the poisson family
with a log link function:
<<RC1_model>>=
RC1model <- gnm(count ~ SES + MHS + Mult(SES, MHS), family = poisson,
                data = mentalHealth)
RC1model
@ %def
The row scores (parameters 10 to 15) and the column scores (parameters 16 to 19)
of the multiplicative interaction can be normalized as in Agresti's eqn (9.15):
<<Normalize_scores>>=
rowProbs <- with(mentalHealth, tapply(count, SES, sum) / sum(count))
colProbs <- with(mentalHealth, tapply(count, MHS, sum) / sum(count))
rowScores <- coef(RC1model)[10:15]
colScores <- coef(RC1model)[16:19]
rowScores <- rowScores - sum(rowScores * rowProbs)
colScores <- colScores - sum(colScores * colProbs)
beta1 <- sqrt(sum(rowScores^2 * rowProbs))
beta2 <- sqrt(sum(colScores^2 * colProbs))
assoc <- list(beta = beta1 * beta2,
              mu = rowScores / beta1,
              nu = colScores / beta2)
assoc
@ %def
Alternatively, the elliptical contrasts \Robject{mu} and \Robject{nu} can be
obtained using \Rfunction{getContrasts}, with the advantage that the standard
errors for the contrasts will also be computed:
@
<<Elliptical_contrasts>>=
mu <- getContrasts(RC1model, pickCoef(RC1model, "[.]SES"),
                   ref = rowProbs, scaleWeights = rowProbs)
nu <- getContrasts(RC1model, pickCoef(RC1model, "[.]MHS"),
                   ref = colProbs, scaleWeights = colProbs)
mu
nu
@ %def
Since the value of \Robject{beta} is dependent upon the particular
scaling used for the contrasts,
it is typically not of interest
to conduct inference on this parameter directly. The
standard error for \Robject{beta} could be obtained, if desired, via the delta
method.

\subsubsection{RC(2) model}

The RC(1) model can be extended to an RC($m$) model with $m$ components of the
multiplicative interaction. For example, the RC(2) model is given by
\[
\log \mu_{rc} = \alpha_r + \beta_c + \gamma_r\delta_c + \theta_r\phi_c.
\]
Extra instances of the multiplicative interaction can be specified by the
\Rfunarg{multiplicity} argument of \Rfunction{Mult}, so the RC(2) model can be
fitted to the \Robject{mentalHealth} data as follows
<<RC2_model>>=
RC2model <- gnm(count ~ SES + MHS + instances(Mult(SES, MHS), 2),
                family = poisson, data = mentalHealth)
RC2model
@

\subsubsection{Homogeneous effects}

If the row and column factors have the same levels, or perhaps some levels in
common, then the row-column interaction could be modelled by a multiplicative
interaction with homogeneous effects, that is
\[\log \mu_{rc} = \alpha_r + \beta_c + \gamma_r\gamma_c.\]
For example, the \Robject{occupationalStatus} data set from \citet{Good79} is a
contingency table classified by the occupational status of fathers (origin) and
their sons (destination). \citet{Good79} fits a row-column association model
with homogeneous effects to these data after deleting the cells on the main
diagonal. Equivalently we can account for the diagonal effects by a separate
\Rfunction{Diag} term:
@
<<Homogeneous_effects>>=
data(occupationalStatus)
RChomog <- gnm(Freq ~ origin + destination + Diag(origin, destination) +
               MultHomog(origin, destination), family = poisson,
               data = occupationalStatus)
RChomog
@ %def

To determine whether it would be better to allow for heterogeneous effects on
the association of the fathers' occupational status and the sons' occupational
status, we can compare this model to the RC(1) model for these data:
<<Heterogeneous_effects>>=
data(occupationalStatus)
RCheterog <- gnm(Freq ~ origin + destination + Diag(origin, destination) +
               Mult(origin, destination), family = poisson,
               data = occupationalStatus)
anova(RChomog, RCheterog)
@
In this case there is little gain in allowing heterogeneous effects.

\subsection{Diagonal reference models}
\label{sec:Dref}

Diagonal reference models, proposed by \citet{Sobe81, Sobe85}, are designed for
contingency tables classified by factors with the same levels. The cell
means are modelled as a function of the diagonal effects, i.e., the mean
responses of the `diagonal' cells in which the levels of the row and
column factors are the same.

\subsubsection*{\Rfunction{Dref} example 1: Political consequences of
social mobility}

To illustrate the use of diagonal reference models we shall use the
\Robject{voting} data from \citet{Clif93}. The data come from the 1987 British
general election and are the percentage voting Labour in groups cross-classified
by the class of the head of household (\Robject{destination}) and the class of
their father (\Robject{origin}). In order to weight these percentages by the
group size, we first back-transform them to the counts of those voting Labour
and those not voting Labour:
@
<<Transform_to_counts>>=
set.seed(1)
data(voting)
count <- with(voting, percentage/100 * total)
yvar <- cbind(count, voting$total - count)
@ %def

The grouped percentages may be modelled by a basic diagonal reference model, that
is, a weighted sum of the diagonal effects for the corresponding origin and
destination classes. This model may be expressed as
\[
\mu_{od} = \frac{e^{\delta_1}}{e^{\delta_1} + e^{\delta_2}}\gamma_o +
\frac{e^{\delta_2}}{e^{\delta_1} + e^{\delta_2}}\gamma_d .
\]
See Section \ref{sec:Dref function} for more detail on the parameterization.

The basic diagonal reference model may be fitted using \Rfunction{gnm} as
follows
@
<<Class_mobility>>=
classMobility <- gnm(yvar ~ Dref(origin, destination),
                       family = binomial, data = voting)
classMobility
@ %def
and the origin and destination weights can be evaluated as below
@
<<Class_mobility_weights>>=
DrefWeights(classMobility)
@ %def
These results are slightly different from those reported by \citet{Clif93}.
The reason for this is unclear: we are confident that the
above results are correct for the
data as given in \citet{Clif93}, but have not been able to confirm
that the data
as printed in the journal were exactly as used in Clifford and Heath's
analysis.

\citet{Clif93} suggest that movements in and out of the salariat (class 1)
should be treated differently from movements between the lower classes (classes
2 - 5), since the former has a greater effect on social status. Thus they
propose the following model
\begin{equation*}
\mu_{od} = \begin{cases}
\dfrac{e^{\delta_1}}{e^{\delta_1} + e^{\delta_2}}\gamma_o +
\dfrac{e^{\delta_2}}{e^{\delta_1} + e^{\delta_2}}\gamma_d & \text{if } o = 1\\
\\
\dfrac{e^{\delta_3}}{e^{\delta_3} + e^{\delta_4}}\gamma_o +
\dfrac{e^{\delta_4}}{e^{\delta_3} + e^{\delta_4}}\gamma_d & \text{if } d = 1\\
\\
\dfrac{e^{\delta_5}}{e^{\delta_5} + e^{\delta_6}}\gamma_o +
\dfrac{e^{\delta_6}}{e^{\delta_5} + e^{\delta_6}}\gamma_d & \text{if } o \ne 1
\text{ and } d \ne 1
\end{cases}
\end{equation*}
To fit this model we define factors indicating movement in (upward) and out
(downward) of the salariat
@
<<Salariat_factors>>=
upward <- with(voting, origin != 1 & destination == 1)
downward <- with(voting, origin == 1 & destination != 1)
@ %def
Then the diagonal reference model with separate weights for socially mobile
groups can be estimated as follows
@
<<Social_mobility>>=
socialMobility <- gnm(yvar ~ Dref(origin, destination,
                                  delta = ~ 1 + downward + upward),
                      family = binomial, data = voting)
socialMobility
@ %def
The weights for those moving into the salariat, those moving out of the
salariat and those in any other group, can be evaluated as below
@
<<social_mobility_weights>>=
DrefWeights(socialMobility)
@ %def
Again, the results differ slightly from those reported by \citet{Clif93}, but
the essence of the results is the same: the origin weight is much larger for the
downwardly mobile group than for the other groups. The weights for the upwardly
mobile group are very similar to the base level weights, so the model may be
simplified by only fitting separate weights for the downwardly mobile group:
@
<<Downward_mobility>>=
downwardMobility <- gnm(yvar ~ Dref(origin, destination,
                                    delta = ~ 1 + downward),
                        family = binomial, data = voting)
downwardMobility
DrefWeights(downwardMobility)
@ %def

\subsubsection*{\Rfunction{Dref} example 2: conformity to parental rules}

%\SweaveInput{vanDerSlikEg.Rnw}

Another application of diagonal reference models is given by
\citet{Vand02}. The data from this paper are not publicly available\footnote{
We thank Frans van der Slik for his kindness in sending us the data.}, but we
shall show how the models presented in the paper may be estimated using
\Rfunction{gnm}.

The data relate to the value parents place on their children conforming to their
rules. There are two response variables: the mother's conformity score (MCFM)
and the father's conformity score (FCFF). The data are cross-classified by two
factors describing the education level of the mother (MOPLM) and the father
(FOPLF), and there are six further covariates (AGEM, MRMM, FRMF, MWORK, MFCM and
FFCF).

In their baseline model for the mother's conformity score, \citet{Vand02}
include five of the six covariates (leaving out the father's family conflict
score, FCFF) and a diagonal reference term with constant weights based on the
two education factors. This model may be expressed as
\[
\mu_{rci} = \beta_1x_{1i} + \beta_2x_{2i} + \beta_3x_{3i} +\beta_4x_{4i} +\beta_5x_{5i} +
\frac{e^{\delta_1}}{e^{\delta_1} + e^{\delta_2}}\gamma_r +
\frac{e^{\delta_2}}{e^{\delta_1} + e^{\delta_2}}\gamma_c .
\]

The baseline model can be fitted as follows:
\begin{Sinput}
> set.seed(1)
>  A <- gnm(MCFM ~ -1 + AGEM + MRMM + FRMF + MWORK + MFCM +
+           Dref(MOPLM, FOPLF), family = gaussian, data = conformity,

The coefficients of the covariates are not aliased with the parameters of the
diagonal reference term and thus the basic identifiability constraints that have
been imposed are sufficient for these parameters to be identified. The diagonal
effects do not need to be constrained as they represent contrasts with the
off-diagonal cells.  Therefore the only unidentified parameters in this model
are the weight parameters. This is confirmed in the summary of the model:

The weights have been constrained to sum to one as described in Section
\ref{sec:Dref function}, so the weights themselves may be estimated as follows:
\begin{Sinput}
    > prop.table(exp(coef(A)[6:7]))
\end{Sinput}
\begin{Soutput}

\end{Soutput}
However, in order to estimate corresponding standard errors, the parameters of
one of the weights must be constrained. If no such constraints were applied when
the model was fitted, \Rfunction{DrefWeights} will refit the model constraining
the parameters of the first weight to zero:
\begin{Sinput}
> DrefWeights(A)
\end{Sinput}

\end{Soutput}
giving the values reported by \citet{Vand02}. All the other coefficients of
model A are the same as those reported by \citet{Vand02} except the coefficients
of the mother's gender role (MRMM) and the father's gender role
(FRMF). \citet{Vand02} reversed the signs of the coefficients of these factors
since they were coded in the direction of liberal values, unlike the other
covariates. However, simply reversing the signs of these coefficients does not
give the same model, since the estimates of the diagonal effects depend on the
estimates of these coefficients. For consistent interpretation of the covariate
coefficients, it is better to recode the gender role factors as follows:
\begin{Sinput}
> MRMM2 <- as.numeric(!conformity$MRMM)

The coefficients of the covariates are now as reported by \citet{Vand02}, but
the diagonal effects have been adjusted appropriately.

\citet{Vand02} compare the baseline model for the mother's conformity score to
several other models in which the weights in the diagonal reference term are
dependent on one of the covariates. One particular model they consider
incorporates an interaction of the weights with the mother's conflict score as
follows:
\[
\mu_{rci} = \beta_1x_{1i} + \beta_2x_{2i} + \beta_3x_{3i} +\beta_4x_{4i} +\beta_5x_{5i} +
\frac{e^{\xi_{01} + \xi_{11}x_{5i}}}{e^{\xi_{01} + \xi_{11}x_{5i}} +
e^{\xi_{02} + \xi_{12}x_{5i}}}\gamma_r + \frac{e^{\xi_{02} +
  \xi_{12}x_{5i}}}{e^{\xi_{01} + \xi_{11}x_{5i}}
+ e^{\xi_{02} + \xi_{12}x_{5i}}}\gamma_c.
\]

This model can be fitted as below, using the original coding for the gender
role factors for ease of comparison to the results reported by \citet{Vand02},
\begin{Sinput}
> F <- gnm(MCFM ~ -1 + AGEM + MRMM + FRMF + MWORK + MFCM +

In this case there are two sets of weights, one for when the mother's conflict
score is less than average (coded as zero) and one for when the score is greater
than average (coded as one). These can be evaluated as follows:

giving the same weights as in Table 4 of \citet{Vand02}, though we obtain a
lower standard error in the case where MFCM is equal to one.

\subsection{Uniform difference (UNIDIFF) models}
\label{sec:Unidiff}

Uniform difference models \citep{Xie92, Erik92} use a simplified three-way
interaction to provide an interpretable model of contingency tables classified
by three or more variables. For example, the uniform difference model for a
three-way contingency table, also known as the UNIDIFF model, is given by
\[
\mu_{ijk} = \alpha_{ik} + \beta_{jk} + \exp(\delta_k)\gamma_{ij}.
\]
The $\gamma_{ij}$ represent a pattern of association that varies in strength
over the dimension indexed by $k$, and $\exp(\delta_k)$ represents the relative
strength of that association at level $k$.

This model can be applied to the \Robject{yaish} data set
\citep{Yais98,Yais04},
which is a
contingency table cross-classified by father's social class (\Robject{orig}),
son's social
class (\Robject{dest}) and son's education level (\Robject{educ}).
In this case, we can consider the
importance of the association between the social class of father and son across
the education levels.  We omit the sub-table which corresponds to level 7 of
\Robject{dest}, because its information content is negligible:
@
<<UNIDIFF_model>>=
set.seed(1)
data(yaish)
unidiff <- gnm(Freq ~ educ*orig + educ*dest + Mult(Exp(educ), orig:dest),
               ofInterest = "[.]educ", family = poisson,
               data = yaish, subset = (dest != 7))
coef(unidiff)
@ %def
The \Robject{ofInterest} component has been set to index the multipliers of the
association between the social class of father and son. We can contrast each
multiplier to that of the lowest education level and obtain the standard errors
for these parameters as follows:
@
<<Unidiff_contrasts>>=
getContrasts(unidiff, ofInterest(unidiff))
@ %def

Four-way contingency tables may sometimes be described by a
``double UNIDIFF'' model
\[
\mu_{ijkl} = \alpha_{il} + \beta_{jkl} + \exp(\delta_l)\gamma_{ij} +
\exp(\phi_l)\theta_{ik},
\]
where the strengths of two, two-way associations with a common variable are
estimated across the levels of the fourth variable.
The \Robject{cautres} data set, from \citet{Caut98}, can be used to illustrate
the application of the
double UNIDIFF model. This data set is classified by the variables vote, class,
religion and election. Using a double UNIDIFF model, we can see how the
association between class and vote, and the association between religion and
vote, differ between the most recent election and the other elections:
@
<<double_UNIDIFF_model>>=
set.seed(1)
data(cautres)
doubleUnidiff <- gnm(Freq ~ election*vote + election*class*religion +
                     Mult(Exp(election), religion:vote) +
                     Mult(Exp(election), class:vote),

             family = poisson, data = cautres)
getContrasts(doubleUnidiff, rev(pickCoef(doubleUnidiff, ", class:vote")))
getContrasts(doubleUnidiff, rev(pickCoef(doubleUnidiff, ", religion:vote")))
@ %def

multiplicative interaction (GAMMI) models}
\label{sec:GAMMI}

Generalized additive main effects and multiplicative interaction models, or
GAMMI models, were motivated by two-way contingency tables and comprise the row
and column main effects plus one or more components of the multiplicative
interaction. The singular value corresponding to each multiplicative component
is often factored out, as a measure of the strength of association between the
row and column scores, indicating the importance of the component, or axis.

For cell means $\mu_{rc}$ a GAMMI-K model has the form

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:GAMMI}
    g(\mu_{rc}) = \alpha_r + \beta_c + \sum_{k=1}^K
    \sigma_k\gamma_{kr}\delta_{kc},
\end{equation}
in which $g$ is a link function, $\alpha_r$ and $\beta_c$ are the row and column
main effects, $\gamma_{kr}$ and $\delta_{kc}$ are the row and column scores for
multiplicative component $k$ and $\sigma_k$ is the singular value for component
$k$. The number of multiplicative components, $K$, is less than or equal to the
rank of the matrix of residuals from the main effects.

The row-column association models discussed in Section \ref{sec:RCmodels} are
examples of GAMMI models, with a log link and poisson variance. Here we
illustrate the use of an AMMI model, which is a GAMMI model with an identity
link and a constant variance.

We shall use the \Robject{wheat} data set taken from \citet{Varg01}, which gives
wheat yields measured over ten years. First we scale these yields and
create a new treatment factor, so that we can reproduce the analysis of
\citet{Varg01}:
@
<<Scale_yields>>=
set.seed(1)
data(wheat)
yield.scaled <- wheat$yield * sqrt(3/1000)
treatment <- interaction(wheat$tillage, wheat$summerCrop, wheat$manure,
                         wheat$N, sep = "")
@ %def
Now we can fit the AMMI-1 model, to the scaled yields using the combined
treatment factor and the year factor from the \Robject{wheat} dataset.  We
will proceed by first fitting the main effects model, then using
\Rfunction{residSVD} (see Section \ref{sec:residSVD}) for the parameters
of the multiplicative term:
@
<<AMMI_model>>=
mainEffects <- gnm(yield.scaled ~ year + treatment, family = gaussian,
                   data = wheat)
svdStart <- residSVD(mainEffects, year, treatment, 3)
bilinear1 <- update(mainEffects, . ~ . + Mult(year, treatment),
                    start = c(coef(mainEffects), svdStart[,1]))
@ %def
We can compare the AMMI-1 model to the main effects model,
@
<<AOD>>=
anova(mainEffects, bilinear1, test = "F")
@ %def
giving the same results as in Table 1 of \citet{Varg01} (up to error caused by
rounding).

Thus the significance of the multiplicative interaction can be tested without
applying constraints to this term. If the multiplicative interaction is
significant, we may wish to apply constraints to obtain estimates of the row and
column scores. We illustrate this using the \Robject{barleyHeights} data, which
records the average height for 15 genotypes of barley over 9 years.

For this small dataset the AMMI-1 model is easily estimated with the default
settings:
@
<<AMMI_model2>>=
set.seed(1)
data(barleyHeights)
barleyModel <- gnm(height ~ year + genotype + Mult(year, genotype),
                   data = barleyHeights)
@ %def
To obtain the parameterization of Equation \ref{eq:GAMMI} in which $\sigma_k$ is
the singular value for component $k$, the row and column scores must be
constrained so that the scores sum to zero and the squared scores sum to
one. These contrasts can be obtained using \Robject{getContrasts}:
@
<<Spherical_contrasts>>=
gamma <- getContrasts(barleyModel, pickCoef(barleyModel, "[.]y"),
                      ref = "mean", scaleWeights = "unit")
delta <- getContrasts(barleyModel, pickCoef(barleyModel, "[.]g"),
                      ref = "mean", scaleWeights = "unit")
gamma
delta
@ %def
Confidence intervals based on the assumption of asymptotic normality can be
computed as follows:
@
<<CI>>=
gamma[[2]][,1] + (gamma[[2]][,2]) %o% c(-1.96, 1.96)
delta[[2]][,1] + (delta[[2]][,2]) %o% c(-1.96, 1.96)
@ %def
which broadly agree with Table 8 of Chadouef and Denis (1991), allowing for the
change in sign.

On the basis of such confidence intervals we can investigate simplifications of
the model such as combining levels of the factors or fitting an additive
model to a subset of the data.

The singular value $\sigma_k$ may be obtained as follows
@
<<SVD>>=
svd(termPredictors(barleyModel)[, "Mult(year, genotype)"])$d
@ %def
This parameter is of little interest in itself, given that the significance of
the term as a whole can be tested using ANOVA.


\subsection{Biplot models}
\label{sec:biplot}

Biplots are graphical displays of two-dimensional arrays, which represent the
objects that index both dimensions of the array on the same plot. Here we
consider the case of a two-way table, where a biplot may be used to represent
both the row and column categories simultaneously.

A two-dimensional biplot is constructed from a rank-2 representation of the
data. For two-way tables, the generalized bilinear model defines one such
representation:
\begin{equation*}
    g(\mu_{ij}) = \eta_{ij} = \alpha_{1i}\beta_{1j} + \alpha_{2i}\beta_{2j}
\end{equation*}
since we can alternatively write
\begin{align*}
    \boldsymbol{\eta} &=
    \begin{pmatrix}
        \alpha_{11} & \alpha_{21} \\
        \vdots & \vdots \\
        \alpha_{1n} & \alpha_{2n} \\
    \end{pmatrix}
    \begin{pmatrix}
        \beta_{11} & \dots & \beta_{1p} \\
        \beta_{21} & \dots & \beta_{2p} \\
    \end{pmatrix} \\
    &= \boldsymbol{AB}^T
\end{align*}
where the columns of $A$ and $B$ are linearly independent by definition.

To demonstrate how the biplot is obtained from this model, we shall use the
\Robject{barley} data set which gives the percentage of leaf area affected by
leaf blotch for ten varieties of barley grown at nine sites
\citep{Wedd74,Gabr98}. As suggested by \citet{Wedd74} we model these data using
a logit link and a variance proportional to the square of that of the binomial,
implemented as the \Rfunction{wedderburn} family in \Rpackage{gnm} (see also
Section \ref{sec:glms}):
@
<<Biplot_model>>=
data(barley)
set.seed(138)
biplotModel <- gnm(y ~ -1 + instances(Mult(site, variety), 2),
                   family = wedderburn, data = barley)
@ %def

The effect of site $i$ can be represented by the point
\[
(\alpha_{1i}, \alpha_{2i})
\]
in the space spanned by the linearly independent basis vectors
\begin{align*}
    a_1 = (\alpha_{11}, \alpha_{12}, \ldots \alpha_{19})^T\\
    a_2 = (\alpha_{21}, \alpha_{22}, \ldots \alpha_{29})^T\\
\end{align*}
and the variable effects can be similarly represented.

Thus we can represent the sites and varieties separately as follows
@
<<Effect_plots, fig = TRUE, include = FALSE, width=10, height=5>>=
sites <- pickCoef(biplotModel, "[.]site")
coefs <- coef(biplotModel)
A <- matrix(coefs[sites], nc = 2)
B <- matrix(coefs[-sites], nc = 2)
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
plot(A, pch = levels(barley$site), xlim = c(-5, 5), ylim = c(-5, 5),
    main = "Site Effects", xlab = "Component 1", ylab = "Component 2")
plot(B, pch = levels(barley$variety), xlim = c(-5, 5), ylim = c(-5, 5),
    main = "Variety Effects", xlab = "Component 1", ylab = "Component 2")
@ %def
\begin{figure}[!tbph]
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics{gnmOverview-Effect_plots.pdf}
    \end{center}
    \caption{Plots of site and variety effects from the generalized bilinear
      model of the barley data.}
    \label{fig:Effect_plots}
\end{figure}

Of course the parameterization of the bilinear model is not unique and therefore
the scale and rotation of the points in these plots will depend on the random
seed. By rotation and reciprocal scaling of the matrices $A$ and $B$,
we can obtain basis vectors with desirable properties without changing the
fitted model.

In particular, if we rotate the matrices $A$ and $B$ so that their columns are
orthogonal, then the corresponding plots will display the euclidean distances
between sites and varieties respectively. If we also scale the matrices $A$ and $B$
so that the corresponding plots have the same units, then we can combine the two
plots to give a conventional biplot display.

The required rotation and scaling can be performed via singular value
decomposition of the fitted predictors:
@
<<Row_and_column_scores>>=
barleySVD <- svd(matrix(biplotModel$predictors, 10, 9))
A <- sweep(barleySVD$v, 2, sqrt(barleySVD$d), "*")[, 1:2]
B <- sweep(barleySVD$u, 2, sqrt(barleySVD$d), "*")[, 1:2]
A
B
@ %def
These matrices are essentially the same as in \citet{Gabr98}. From these the
biplot can be produced, for sites $A \ldots I$ and varieties $1 \dots 9, X$:
@
<<Biplot1, fig = TRUE, include = FALSE>>=
plot(rbind(A, B), pch = c(levels(barley$site), levels(barley$variety)),
     xlim = c(-4, 4), ylim = c(-4, 4), main = "Biplot for barley data",
     xlab = "Component 1", ylab = "Component 2")
text(c(-3.5, -3.5), c(3.9, 3.6), c("sites: A-I","varieties: 1-9, X"), adj = 0)
@ %def
\begin{figure}[!tbph]
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics{gnmOverview-Biplot1.pdf}
    \end{center}
    \caption{Biplot for barley data}
    \label{fig:Biplot1}
\end{figure}
The biplot gives an idea of how the sites and varieties are related to one
another. It also allows us to consider whether the data can be represented by a
simpler model than the generalized bilinear model. We see that the points in the
biplot approximately align with the rotated axes shown in Figure
\ref{fig:Biplot2}, such that the sites fall about a line parallel to
the ``h-axis'' and the varieties group about two lines roughly parallel to the
``v-axis''.
@
<<Biplot2, fig = TRUE, include = FALSE>>=
plot(rbind(A, B), pch = c(levels(barley$site), levels(barley$variety)),
     xlim = c(-4, 4), ylim = c(-4, 4), main = "Biplot for barley data",
     xlab = "Component 1", ylab = "Component 2")
text(c(-3.5, -3.5), c(3.9, 3.6), c("sites: A-I","varieties: 1-9, X"), adj = 0)
abline(a = 0, b = tan(pi/3))
abline(a = 0, b = -tan(pi/6))
abline(a = 2.6, b = tan(pi/3), lty = 2)
abline(a = 4.5, b = tan(pi/3), lty = 2)
abline(a = 1.3, b = -tan(pi/6), lty = 2)
text(2.8, 3.9, "v-axis", font = 3)
text(3.8, -2.7, "h-axis", font = 3)
@ %def
%abline(a = 0, b = tan(3*pi/10), lty = 4)
%abline(a = 0, b = -tan(pi/5), lty = 4)
\begin{figure}[!tbph]
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics{gnmOverview-Biplot2.pdf}
    \end{center}
    \caption{Biplot for barley data, showing approximate alignment with rotated axes.}
    \label{fig:Biplot2}
\end{figure}
This suggests that the sites could be represented by points along a line, with
co-ordinates
\begin{equation*}
    (\gamma_i, \delta_0).
\end{equation*}
and the varieties by points on two lines perpendicular to the site line:
\begin{equation*}
    (\nu_0 + \nu_1I(i \in \{2, 3, 6\}), \omega_j)
\end{equation*}
This corresponds to the following simplification of the bilinear model:
\begin{align*}
    &\alpha_{1i}\beta_{1j} + \alpha_{2i}\beta_{2j} \\
    \approx &\gamma_i(\nu_0 + \nu_1I(i \in \{2, 3, 6\})) + \delta_0\omega_j
\end{align*}
or equivalently
\begin{equation*}
    \gamma_i(\nu_0 + \nu_1I(i \in \{2, 3, 6\})) + \omega_j,
\end{equation*}
the double additive model proposed by \citet{Gabr98}. We can fit this model as
follows:
@
<<Double_additive>>=
variety.binary <- factor(match(barley$variety, c(2,3,6), nomatch = 0) > 0,
                        labels = c("rest", "2,3,6"))
doubleAdditive <- gnm(y ~ variety + Mult(site, variety.binary),
                      family = wedderburn, data = barley)
@ %def
Comparing the chi-squared statistics, we see that the double additive model is
an adequate model for the leaf blotch incidence:
@
<<Compare_chi-squared>>=
biplotModChiSq <- sum(residuals(biplotModel, type = "pearson")^2)
doubleAddChiSq <- sum(residuals(doubleAdditive, type = "pearson")^2)
c(doubleAddChiSq - biplotModChiSq,
  doubleAdditive$df.residual - biplotModel$df.residual)
@ %def

\subsection{Stereotype model for multinomial response}
\label{sec:Stereotype}

The stereotype model was proposed by \citet{Ande84} for ordered categorical
data. It is a special case of the multinomial logistic model, in which the
covariate coefficients are common to all categories but the scale of association
is allowed to vary between categories such that
\[
p_{ic} =  \frac{\exp(\beta_{0c} + \gamma_c
  \boldsymbol{\beta}^T\boldsymbol{x}_{i})}{\sum_{k = 1}^K \exp(\beta_{0k} + \gamma_k
  \boldsymbol{\beta}^T\boldsymbol{x}_{i})}
\]
where $p_{ic}$ is the probability that the response for individual $i$ is
category $c$ and $K$ is the number of categories. Like the multinomial
logistic model, the stereotype model specifies a simple form for the log
odds of one category against another, e.g.
\begin{equation*}
\log\left(\frac{p_{ic}}{p_{ik}}\right) = (\beta_{0c} - \beta_{0k}) + (\gamma_c - \gamma_k)\boldsymbol{\beta}^T\boldsymbol{x}_{i}
\end{equation*}

In order to model a multinomial response in the generalized nonlinear model
framework, we must re-express the data as category counts $Y_i = (Y_{i1},
\ldots, Y_{iK})$ for each individual (or group). Then assuming a Poisson distribution
for the counts $Y_{ic}$, the joint distribution of $Y_i$ is Multinomial$(N_i,
p_{i1}, \ldots, p_{iK})$ conditional on the total count for each individual
$N_i$. The expected counts are then $\mu_{ic} = N_ip_{ic}$ and the parameters of
the sterotype model can be estimated through fitting the following model
\begin{align*}
\log \mu_{ic} &= \log(N_i) + \log(p_{ic}) \\
&= \alpha_i + \beta_{0c} + \gamma_c\sum_r \boldsymbol{\beta}_{r}\boldsymbol{x}_{ir} \\
\end{align*}
where the ``nuisance'' parameters $\alpha_i$ ensure that the multinomial
denominators are reproduced exactly, as required.

The \Rpackage{gnm} package includes the utility function
\Rfunction{expandCategorical} to re-express the categorical response as category
counts. By default, individuals with common values across all covariates are
grouped together, to avoid redundacy.

For example, the \Robject{backPain} data set from \citet{Ande84} describes the
progress of patients with back pain. The data set consists of an ordered factor
quantifying the progress of each patient, and three prognostic variables. We
re-express the data as follows:
@
<<Re-express_data>>=
set.seed(1)
data(backPain)
subset(backPain, x1 == 1 & x2 == 1 & x3 == 1)
backPainLong <- expandCategorical(backPain, "pain")
head(backPainLong)
@ %def
We can now fit the stereotype model to these data:
@
<<Stereotype_model>>=
oneDimensional <- gnm(count ~ pain + Mult(pain, x1 + x2 + x3),
                      eliminate = id, family = "poisson", data = backPainLong)
oneDimensional
@ %def
specifying the \Robject{id} factor through \Rfunarg{eliminate} so that the 12
\Robject{id} effects are estimated more efficiently and are excluded from
printed model summaries by default. This model is one
dimensional since it involves only one function of $\mathbf{x} = (x1, x2,
x3)$. We can compare this model to one with category-specific coefficents of the
$x$ variables, as may be used for a qualitative categorical response:
@
<<Qualitative_model>>=
threeDimensional  <- gnm(count ~ pain + pain:(x1 + x2 + x3), eliminate = id,
                         family = "poisson", data = backPainLong)
threeDimensional
@ %def
This model has the maximum dimensionality of three (as determined by the number
of covariates). The ungrouped multinomial log-likelihoods reported in
\citet{Ande84} are given by
\begin{equation*}
    \sum_{i,c} y_{ic}\log(p_{ic}) = \sum_{i,c} y_{ic}\log(\mu_{ic}/n_{ic})
\end{equation*}
We write a simple function to compute this and the corresponding degrees of
freedom, then compare the log-likelihoods of the one dimensional model and the
three dimensional model:
@
<<Calculate_log-likelihood>>=
logLikMultinom <- function(model, size){
    object <- get(model)
    l <- sum(object$y * log(object$fitted/size))
    c(nParameters = object$rank - object$eliminate, logLikelihood = l)
}
size <- tapply(backPainLong$count, backPainLong$id, sum)[backPainLong$id]
t(sapply(c("oneDimensional", "threeDimensional"), logLikMultinom, size))
@ %def
showing that the \Robject{oneDimensional} model is adequate.

To obtain estimates of the category-specific multipliers in the stereotype
model, we need to constrain both the location and the scale of these
parameters. The latter constraint can be imposed by fixing the slope of one of
the covariates in the second multiplier to \Robject{1}, which may be achieved by
specifying the covariate as an offset:
@
<<Constrain_slopes>>=
## before constraint
summary(oneDimensional)
oneDimensional <- gnm(count ~ pain + Mult(pain, offset(x1) + x2 + x3),
                      eliminate = id, family = "poisson", data = backPainLong)
## after constraint
summary(oneDimensional)
@ %def
The location of the category-specific multipliers can constrained by setting one
of the parameters to zero, either through the \Rfunarg{constrain} argument of
\Rfunction{gnm} or with \Rfunction{getContrasts}:
@
<<Get_slopes>>=
getContrasts(oneDimensional, pickCoef(oneDimensional, "[.]pain"))
@ %def
giving the required estimates.

\subsection{Lee-Carter model for trends in age-specific mortality}


In the study and projection of population mortality rates, the model proposed
by \cite{LeeCart92} forms the basis of many if not most current analyses.
Here we consider the quasi-Poisson version of the model \citep{Wilm93, Alho00,
BrouDenuVerm02, RensHabe03}, in which the death count $D_{ay}$ for individuals
of age $a$ in year $y$ has mean $\mu_{ay}$ and variance $\phi\mu_{ay}$ (where
$\phi$ is 1 for Poisson-distributed counts, and is respectively greater
than or less than 1 in cases of over-dispersion or under-dispersion).  In
the Lee-Carter model, the
expected counts follow the log-bilinear form
\[
\log(\mu_{ay}/e_{ay}) = \alpha_a + \beta_a \gamma_y,
\]
where $e_{ay}$ is the `exposure' (number of lives at risk).  This is
a generalized nonlinear model with a single multiplicative term.

The use of \Rpackage{gnm} to fit this model is straightforward.  We will
illustrate by using data downloaded on 2006-11-14 from the Human Mortality
Database\footnote{Thanks to Iain Currie for helpful advice
relating to this section}
(HMD, made available by the University of California, Berkeley, and Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research, at \texttt{http://www.mortality.org})
on male deaths in Canada between 1921 and
2003.  The data are not made available as part of \Rpackage{gnm} because
of license restrictions; but they are readily available via the web simply by
registering with the HMD.  We assume that the data for Canadian males (both
deaths and exposure-to-risk) have been downloaded from the HMD and organised
into a data frame named \Robject{Canada} in \R, with columns \Robject{Year}
(a factor, with levels \Rcode{1921} to \Rcode{2003}),
\Robject{Age} (a factor, with levels \Rcode{20} to \Rcode{99}),
\Robject{mDeaths} and \Robject{mExposure} (both quantitative).  The Lee-Carter
model may then be specified as
\begin{Sinput}
LCmodel.male <- gnm(mDeaths ~ Age + Mult(Exp(Age), Year),
                    offset = log(mExposure), family = "quasipoisson",
                    data = Canada)
\end{Sinput}
Here we have acknowledged the fact that the model only really makes
sense if all of the $\beta_a$ parameters, which represent the `sensitivity'
of age group $a$ to a change in the level of general mortality
\citep[e.g.,][]{BrouDenuVerm02}, have the same sign.  Without loss of
generality we assume $\beta_a>0$ for all $a$, and we impose this constraint
by using \Rcode{Exp(Age)} instead of just \Rcode{Age} in the
multiplicative term.
Convergence is to a fitted model with residual
deviance 32419.83 on 6399 degrees of freedom --- representing
clear evidence of substantial overdispersion relative to the Poisson
distribution.  In order to explore the lack of fit a little further, we
plot the distribution of Pearson residuals in Figure \ref{fig:LCresplot}:
\begin{Sinput}
par(mfrow = c(2,2))
age <- as.numeric(as.character(Canada$Age))
with(Canada,{
    res <- residuals(LCmodel.male, type = "pearson")
    plot(Age, res, xlab="Age", ylab="Pearson residual",
         main = "(a) Residuals by age")
    plot(Year, res, xlab="Year", ylab="Pearson residual",
         main = "(b) Residuals by year")
    plot(Year[(age>24) & (age<36)], res[(age>24) & (age<36)],
         xlab = "Year", ylab = "Pearson residual",
         main = "(c) Age group 25-35")
    plot(Year[(age>49) & (age<66)], res[(age>49) & (age<66)],
         xlab = "Year", ylab = "Pearson residual",
         main = "(d) Age group 50-65")
})
\end{Sinput}
%$
\begin{figure}[!tbph]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=6in]{fig-LCall.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{Canada, males: plots of residuals from the Lee-Carter model
of mortality}
\label{fig:LCresplot}
\end{figure}
Panel (a) of Figure \ref{fig:LCresplot} indicates that the overdispersion
is not evenly spread through the data, but is largely concentrated in
two age groups, roughly ages 25--35 and 50--65\null.  Panels (c) and (d)
focus on the residuals in each of these two age groups: there is a clear
(and roughly cancelling)
dependence on \Robject{Year}, indicating that the assumed bilinear
interaction between \Robject{Age} and \Robject{Year} does not hold
for the full range of ages and years considered here.

A somewhat more satisfactory Lee-Carter model fit
is obtained if only a subset of
the data is used, namely only those males aged 45 or over:
\begin{Sinput}
LCmodel.maleOver45 <- gnm(mDeaths ~ Age + Mult(Exp(Age), Year),
                          offset = log(mExposure), family = "quasipoisson",
                          data = Canada[age>44,])
\end{Sinput}
The residual deviance now is 12595.44 on 4375 degrees of freedom: still
substantially overdispersed, but less severely so than before.  Again we plot
the distributions of Pearson residuals (Figure \ref{fig:LCresplot2}).
\begin{figure}[!tbph]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=6in]{fig-LCover45.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{Canada, males over 45: plots of residuals from the Lee-Carter model
of mortality}
\label{fig:LCresplot2}
\end{figure}
Still clear departures from the assumed bilinear structure are evident,
especially for age group 81--89; but they are less pronounced than in
the previous model fit.

The main purpose here is only to illustrate how straightforward it
is to work with the Lee-Carter model using \Rfunction{gnm}, but we will take
this example a little further by examining the estimated $\beta_a$
parameters from the last fitted model.  We can use \Rfunction{getContrasts}
to compute quasi standard errors for the logarithms of $\hat\beta_a$ --- the
logarithms
being the result of having used
\Rcode{Exp(Age)} in the model specification ---
and use these in a plot of the coefficients:
\begin{Sinput}
AgeContrasts <- getContrasts(LCmodel.maleOver45, 56:100) ## ages 45 to 89 only
\end{Sinput}
\begin{figure}[!tbph]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{fig-LCqvplot.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{Canada, males over 45, Lee-Carter model: relative sensitivity
of different ages to change in total mortality.}
\label{fig:LCqvplot}
\end{figure}
The plot shows that sensitivity to the general level of mortality is highest
at younger ages, as expected.  An \emph{unexpected} feature is the clear
outlying positions occupied by the estimates for ages 51, 61, 71 and 81:
for each of those ages, the estimated $\beta_a$ coefficient is substantially
less than it is for the neighbouring age groups (and the
error bars indicate clearly that the deviations are larger than could plausibly
be due to chance variation).  This is a curious finding.  An explanation
comes from a look back at the raw death-count data.  In the years between
1921 and 1940, the death counts for ages 31, 41, 51, 61, 71 and 81 all
stand out as being very substantially lower than those of neighbouring
ages
(Figure \ref{fig:deaths2140}: the ages concerned are highlighted in solid red).
The same does \emph{not} hold for later years: after about 1940, the `1' ages
fall in with the general pattern.    This apparent
`age heaping\footnote{Age heaping is common in mortality data: see
\url{http://www.mortality.org/Public/Overview.php}}'  explains
our finding above regarding the
$\beta_a$ coefficients: whilst all age groups have benefited from the general
trend of reduced mortality, the `1' age groups appear to have
benefited least because
their starting point (in the 1920s and 1930s) was lower than would have
been indicated by the general pattern --- hence
$\hat\beta_a$ is smaller
for ages $a=31$, $a=41$,\ldots, $a=81$.

\subsection{Exponential and sum-of-exponentials models for decay curves}

A class of nonlinear functions which arise in various application contexts ---
a notable one being pharmacokinetic studies -- involves one or more
\emph{exponential decay} terms.  For example, a simple decay model with
additive error is
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:singleExp}
y = \alpha + \exp(\beta + \gamma x) + e
\end{equation}
(with $\gamma<0$), while a more complex (`sum of exponentials')
model might involve two decay
terms:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:twoExp}
y = \alpha + \exp(\beta_1 + \gamma_1 x) + \exp(\beta_2+ \gamma_2 x) + e.
\end{equation}
Estimation and inference with such models are typically not straightforward,
partly on account of multiple local maxima in the likelihood
\citep[e.g.,][Ch.3]{Sebe89}.  We illustrate the difficulties here, with a
couple of artificial examples.  These examples will make clear the value
of making repeated calls to \Rfunction{gnm}, in order to use different,
randomly-generated parameterizations and starting values and thus improve
the chances of locating both the global maximum and all local maxima of the
likelihood.

\subsubsection{Example: single exponential decay term}

Let us first construct some data from model (\ref{eq:singleExp}).  For our
illustrative purposes here, we will use \emph{noise-free} data, i.e., we
fix the variance of $e$ to be zero; for the other parameters we will use
$\alpha=0$, $\beta = 0$, $\gamma = -0.1$.
@
<<singleExp>>=
x <- 1:100
y <- exp(- x / 10)
set.seed(1)
saved.fits <- list()
for (i in 1:100) saved.fits[[i]] <- gnm(y ~ Exp(1 + x), verbose = FALSE)
table(zapsmall(sapply(saved.fits, deviance)))
@ %def
The \Robject{saved.fits} object thus contains the results of 100 calls to
\Rfunction{gnm}, each using a different, randomly-generated starting value
for the vector of parameters $(\alpha, \beta, \gamma)$.  Out of 100 fits, 52
reproduce the data exactly, to machine accuracy.
The remaining 48 fits are all identical to one another, but they are far from
globally optimal, with residual sum of squares 3.61: they result from
divergence of $\hat\gamma$ to $+\infty$, and correspondingly of $\hat\beta$
to $-\infty$, such that the fitted `curve' is in fact just a constant, with
level equal to $\bar{y}=0.09508$.  For example, the second of the 100 fits
is of this kind:
@
<<singleExp2>>=
saved.fits[[2]]
@ %def
The use of repeated calls to \Rfunction{gnm}, as here,
allows the local and global
maxima to be easily distinguished.

\subsubsection{Example: sum of two exponentials}

We can conduct a similar exercise based on the more complex model
(\ref{eq:twoExp}):
@
<<doubleExp>>=
x <- 1:100
y <- exp(- x / 10) + 2 * exp(- x / 50)
set.seed(1)
saved.fits <- list()
for (i in 1:100)
    saved.fits[[i]] <- suppressWarnings(gnm(y ~ Exp(1 + x, inst = 1) +
                                            Exp(1 + x, inst = 2),
                                            verbose = FALSE))
round(unlist(sapply(saved.fits, deviance)), 4)
@ %def
In this instance, only 37 of the 100 calls to \Rfunction{gnm} have successfully
located a local maximum of the likelihood: in the remaining 63 cases the
starting values generated were such that numerical problems resulted, and the
fitting algorithm was abandoned (giving a \Robject{NULL} result).
Among the 37 `successful'
fits, it is evident that there are three distinct solutions (with respective
residual sums of squares equal to 0.1589, 41.64, and essentially zero ---
the last of these, the exact fit to the data, having been found 12 times
out of the above 37).
The two non-optimal local maxima here correspond to the best fit
with a single exponential (which has residual sum of squares 0.1589) and to the
fit with no dependence at all on $x$
(residual sum of squares 41.64), as we can see
by comparing with:
@
<<doubleExp2, fig = TRUE, include = FALSE>>=
singleExp <- gnm(y ~ Exp(1 + x), start = c(NA, NA, -0.1), verbose = FALSE)
singleExp
meanOnly <- gnm(y ~ 1, verbose = FALSE)
meanOnly
plot(x, y, main = "Two sub-optimal fits to a sum-of-exponentials curve")
lines(x, fitted(singleExp))
lines(x, fitted(meanOnly), lty = "dashed")
@ %def

\begin{figure}[!tbph]
    \centering
    \includegraphics{gnmOverview-doubleExp2.pdf}
    \caption{Two sub-optimal fits to a sum-of-exponentials curve}
    \label{fig:doubleExp}
\end{figure}

In this example, it is clear that
even a small amount of noise in the data would make it
practically impossible to distinguish between competing
models containing one and two exponential-decay terms.

In summary: the default \Rfunction{gnm} setting of randomly-chosen starting
values is useful for identifying multiple local maxima in the likelihood; and
reasonably good starting values are needed if the global maximum is to be
found.  In the present example, knowing that $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$ should
both be small and negative, we might perhaps have tried
@
<<doubleExp3>>=
gnm(y ~ instances(Exp(1 + x), 2), start = c(NA, NA, -0.1, NA, -0.1),
    verbose = FALSE)
@ %def
which reliably yields the (globally optimal) perfect fit to the data.
